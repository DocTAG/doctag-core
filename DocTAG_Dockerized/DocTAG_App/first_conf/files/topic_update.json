      "title": "Home schooling",
      "description": "Identify documents that discuss the education of children at home (home schooling).",
      "narrative": "A relevant document would contain any data on the education of children in a home environment. Included could be data on where, by whom,  community acceptance, and successes.  Additional data on programs aiding the education of disadvantaged children in an away-from-school environment such as mobile vehicle classrooms would be considered as home schooling and are therefore relevant."
