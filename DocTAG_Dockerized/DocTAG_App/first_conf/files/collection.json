But Lord David Montgomery criticised Menem for raising the issue, saying \"bilateral mechanisms are already in place to continue discussions on all subjects. Mr Menem's statement seems to ignore the rights of the Falkland Islanders in the matter of self-determination,\" he added. The two countries fought a brief war over the islands in 1992."

            "text": "Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Article by Maria O'Donnell from the Falklands Islands] [Text] The Argentine Government was able to obtain the results of seismic studies made around the Malvinas Islands, which is the first step in the search for oil. The results were obtained through Roman Oil, a U.S. company stationed in Houston that was used as a cover by Government Oil Deposits (YPF) to buy the maps. According to a top source in the Malvinas government, YPF is the first and only oil company so far to pay $3.2 million for the seismic maps. Great Britain approved legislation two years ago allowing the Falklands Islands Government to start seismic studies in the area. Argentina reacted by sending \"letters of discomfort\" [preceding three words in English] to oil companies warning them that any activities carried out in the waters around the Malvinas Islands without its consent could lead to a legal conflict in the future. Without taking the threat into account, the island's government granted the license to carry out the studies to Geko Prakla (U.S. company) and Spectrum (British), which put the study results up for sale late last year. This daily was able to learn that it was suspicious to the island's government that the first oil company interested in buying the maps was Roman Oil, an oil company never heard of before by the island's advisers, the British Geological Survey. This is why the Kelpers did not hesitate to put a good method of investigation into operation. Since the islanders believed the seismic studies could be very valuable to Argentina, they started investigating from that side. The first thing they learned was that Gaffny Klain, a British consultant with an office in Houston that advises the Argentine Government on oil matters, had recommended the purchase of the survey made by Geko Prakla and Spectrum. But they were not able to learn much about Roman Oil, which has a telephone not listed in the Houston directory. Finally, their links to the companies that carried out the seismic studies turned suspicion to reality: YPF was the real name of the mysterious oil company that bought the maps, according to confirmation made unofficially by Spectrum and Geko Prakla to the Falklands Islands Government. The Malvinas government gets a percentage of the survey result's sale. There are no secrets on the island. A kelper said: \"It is the type of community that when one goes to the supermarket and buys cereal the neighbor does not eat, he would come and ask if there is something wrong with your stomach.\" This is why the news spreads real fast among its 2,000 inhabitants. Adviser Wendy Teggart said: \"It is a rumor but it seems that YPF bought the seismic studies.\" But she immediately said it was true by adding: \"It is better for us because if YPF decides to buy the license, it would mean a recognition in some way of the Falklands Islands Government's sovereignty over its waters.\" When Great Britain began the search for oil in the islands without consulting Argentina, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said it would be impossible for Great Britain to continue the process on those terms because no oil company would risk millions of dollars in waters that are under disputed sovereignty. The island's government members who were asked by this daily said that if there is indeed exploitable oil in large quantities, no international oil companies, and certainly not those that have no interest in Argentina, will be stopped by a juridical dispute. They said the first proof that business is more important than conflicts over sovereignty is the fact that the first company that bought the seismic studies was Argentina's YPF. At any rate, they said, this information will help the Argentine Government in the high-level meeting on hydrocarbons to be held with the Foreign Office late in March or early April in Buenos Aires. The Argentine Foreign Ministry will say in the meeting that the search for oil will need cooperation between Argentina and the kelpers. This is what the government has been saying since the British went ahead with the seismic survey without consultation, which is the first, and most simple, and less costly step of the process. The result of the survey involving a study of the terrain through probes was \"optimistic.\" The survey said there may be oil in the islands. And the only way to prove it is to go ahead with the second stage: the exploration that involves drilling in territory claimed by Argentina and Great Britain. Meanwhile, David Camp, the island's attorney general, is going ahead in drawing up legislation for issuing exploration and exploitation licenses. What happens is that because of the investment required in drilling exploration wells, the licenses that will be attractive to the oil companies are those that guarantee -- if oil is found -- their indisputable rights for 20 or 30 years for the third and last stage: exploitation. The current subject of conversation among the kelpers is the possibility of finding oil in the islands. Their main concern is that the oil companies may damage the islands' ecological balance and cause massive immigration, changing the life style of their small community. To answer this type of question, the islands government has recently contracted the services of the company Environment Resources Management (ERM), which within three months will deliver a report on the impact the discovery of oil would have on the islands. It also sent a delegation to the North Sea and began paying the salary of Alex Camp, an internationally known oil tax expert. The possibility of discussing the oil issue with Argentina is not yet in the kelpers' plans. The only thing they are sure of is that YPF bought the survey studies, and that they will be absent in the discussions if the meeting on hydrocarbons between Argentina and Britain is held in Buenos Aires."

            "text": "Language: English Article Type:BFN [Article by Beatriz V. Goyoaga] [Text] According to Lower House Foreign Relations Committee chairman Florencio Acenolaza, the existence of oil around the Malvinas has not been proven and if any were to be found, the amount would be so small and the difficulties of exploitation so extraordinary that it would not be commercially viable. The existence of oil in the Malvinas has been a source of conflict between Argentina and Britain. The UK (as published by the Herald) recently announced a major oil industry impact study but the Argentine deputy denounces the existence of oil as \"a lie and a political maneuver to manipulate Argentina when discussing fisheries or sovereignty. This (manipulation) is not only encouraged by the Foreign Office but also by people in this country who wish to change current Argentine policy.\" Acenolaza believes that the existing oil basins are all under Argentine territorial jurisdiction and exploitation conditions are the most difficult in the world -- so difficult that oil prices would be as high as $50 per barrel when world prices are under 15. \"The existence of oil is an invention of British authorities as a strategy to gain a better position when discussing fisheries or sovereignty. It is untrue and a blatant lie that there is oil in the Malvinas. The UK is manipulating information aimed at confusing public opinion over the real possibility of finding oil in the islands.\" Deputy Acenolaza, himself a geologist, underlines that former state oil company YPF had prospected in the Malvinas and the existence of oil could not be proven. On this subject, YPF spokesman Juan Carlos Ferrari declined comment, explaining that the company \"does not have or give any information regarding oil in the Malvinas.\" He also added that in 1933 a member of the Foreign Office had said that there was no oil in Saudi Arabia. \"Geologists know that geological conditions to certify the existence of oil-fields in the Malvinas do not exist. Both islands are made of Paleozoic rock, which lack the natural raw material to generate hydrocarbons. The stratographic base, made of crystalline rocks, has a natural incapacity to hold hydrocarbons. It is equally impossible with the quartz or sandy rocks which make up the greater part of the territory.\" The deputy also underlined that in the South Atlantic and the British exclusion zone there are two oil basins dating back to Jurassic times, which correspond to the geological formation of the Patagonian oil basins. He recognizes the existence of three oil basins with insignificant amounts of oil. The \"Cuenca de Malvinas\" basin to the southwest of the islands was surveyed by a concession which discovered oil and gas only in two wells (Ciclon XI and Salmon XII) but in such small quantities that it did not justify exploitation. The geological information of the \"Banco Burwood\" basin to the Northwest is reportedly so limited that no guarantee for the existence of hydrocarbons can be given. In the third basin -- \"Cuenca de San Julian\" -- the sedimentary depths hardly reach 2,500 meters and the existence of \"generating rocks\" for oil has not been proven. According to the deputy, the barometric and weather conditions of the three basins together with the low price of oil make the possibilities of finding oil in the Malvinas irrelevant."

            "text": "Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Article by Daniel Santoro; copyrighted by CLARIN] [Text] The Argentine Foreign Ministry and the Foreign Office (British Foreign Ministry) on 30 December released a joint communique stating that \"the British Government authorizes fishing\" in 1994 in the area known as the outside zone, which is located west of the Malvinas islands. The communique opens almost 100 percent of the fishing zone that London unilaterally imposed in 1986 around the islands. The Argentine-British communique states that the Kelpers (the islanders) in 1994 may fish only 150,000 tons of squid, both in the 150-mile zone around the Malvinas (known as FICZ [expansion unknown], which is its English acronym), and in the outside zone (FOCZ [expansion unknown]). This figure was agreed upon at the negotiations on 1 November 1993 (for Argentina, the maritime limit is 220 miles). Fishing and prospecting for oil are two issues intimately linked with the conflict over sovereignty over the islands. The communique, which was simultaneously released in London and Buenos Aires on 30 December, takes into account the so-called sovereignty protection \"umbrella\" the two countries agreed upon in 1990. In its substantive part, the communique states: \"The Argentine and British Governments today declared that in line with the previous exchanges between the two governments, the British Government will authorize fishing during the 1994 season in the maritime zone described in the annex to the joint declaration of 28 November 1990.\" The short communique means that Great Britain has agreed to issue a joint communique to announce a measure that it was going to adopt unilaterally, in order to facilitate the Argentine Government's presentation to the nation of its new progress in the South Atlantic. The complex diplomatic language, however, reveals that the decision to authorize fishing in the zone -- where all types of fishing were banned for two years -- was made by London, and that it was not a joint decision. It is not merely a matter of semantics. The area that has been opened to third-party ships is as big as Rio Negro Province. In 1990, then-Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo, shortly after the reestablishment of diplomatic relations, managed to release a joint communique in which the two countries decided to simultaneously ban fishing in the outside zone. But, as CLARIN noted on that occasion, the fact that no ships with Argentine license are allowed to operate in that zone and National Prefecture ships cannot patrol it either shows that both joint communiques are a nice envelope for a bitter measure: the expansion of the British fishing zone around the Malvinas. In this regard, Kelper John Barton -- the Malvinas Fishing Department chief -- has clarified things to REDES magazine: \"In the zone known as FOCZ, fishing will be allowed only with a license granted by our government.\" The only British concession obtained in the last negotiations, along with the decision to release a joint communique, is to maintain the 150,000-metric ton ceiling for the licenses to be granted by the Kelpers. [The same newspaper, on the same date and page, adds: \"Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella on 30 December said the Argentine-British joint communique was `very positive' for a series of reasons. ``Petrella told CLARIN: `It is a text that was agreed upon by the two countries, and not a unilateral measure. Great Britain, which could have adopted a unilateral decision, preferred not to do it, thus preserving the level of bilateral relations.' ``Petrella, who on 30 December replaced Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who went on vacation, emphasized that the communique `has the same value as a communique' [as published] and noted that the fact that it was issued within the framework of the sovereignty protection `umbrella maintains the validity of the fact that Great Britain admits that it is a disputed zone.''']"

Government sources think it unlikely that Argentine interests will end up operating installations on the islands themselves, but believe Argentina's coast could be a logical site for support operations. Preliminary results from seismic surveys conducted last year around the Falklands suggested the possibility of finding oil across a zone 25 percent larger than the North Sea. The disclosure of Britain's position follows a recent request from Buenos Aires for a meeting of senior foreign ministry officials to discuss joint development of oil resources. London has yet to agree to this meeting. Reaching an oil accord with the UK is Argentina's next important policy objective, but it is unlikely to accept terms that implicitly recognise Britain's sovereignty over the islands. Buenos Aires has used recent talks on fish to press for a role in the development of possible oil and gas reserves. British Gas said last year it had discussed joint offshore exploration close to the disputed waters with YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil company. Some Falkland islanders are said to recognise that rapprochement with Argentina would probably be necessary if an oil industry were to be developed. Recent developments come against a background of steadily improving relations between the two former belligerents. A year ago, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, became the first UK cabinet minister to visit Argentina since the 1982 Falkland islands conflict. Since then both Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, and Mr Guido Di Tella, foreign minister, have visited Britain."

            "text": "BFN [From the Economic Panorama Column by Miriam Leitao: \"Strong Ties\"] [Text] Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] President Joel Renno was in Buenos Aires on 13 April closing several deals. One of them is very curious: The Brazilian company sold 20 percent of its participation in a prospecting area in the southern Argentine sea platform between Tierra del Fuego and the Malvinas Islands. Do you know to whom it was sold? To YPF [Government Oil Deposits], which no longer has the oil industry monopoly and is no longer a public company. Renno did not reveal the operation's value. In that prospecting area, Petrobras already had invested $7 million by drilling the first well and will invest an additional $12 million by drilling the first well 120 meters below the water level. Petrobras is associated in the deal with the company BHP Australia and other European companies. Even by selling 20 percent of its participation, Petrobras still holds 40 percent of the capital of this enterprise, which is called San Julian-Marine. \"We are still the largest shareholders in the deal,\" Renno said. Petrobras also is investing in a new gas prospecting area in northwestern Argentina and is selling fuel oil to Buenos Aires thermal electric plants. \"Brazil is currently the main buyer of Argentine oil and Argentina is our second supplier after Saudi Arabia,\" Brazilian Ambassador to Argentina Marcos Azambuja said. Yesterday was a good day to commemorate the increase of Brazilian purchases. The Argentine Government has published its January trade balance figures. And there was no good news. Argentina registered a $600 million deficit, which is larger than last year's accumulated January-May deficit. The Argentine trade deficit with Brazil in January was $96 million. Yesterday was a typical Mercosur [Common Market of the South] day in the Brazilian Embassy in Buenos Aires. A group of 40 Brazilian businessmen who already have businesses in Argentina was holding a meeting to analyze new business opportunities in the Argentine market. \"They meet once a month,\" said Brazilian Embassy minister counselor Pedro Luis Rodriguez, who is also enthusiastic about the cooperation possibilities between the two countries."

[Campora] I believe the date is closer and closer. The president has received invitations from all the countries that are partners of the United Kingdom. He was the first Latin American president to be invited by the Clinton administration. If matters continue as they have, Great Britain will be excluding itself from a relationship with a chief of state that has such a level of consideration. It is a situation that lacks common sense because common sense has always been one of the virtues that Anglo-Saxons postulate. The president's trip will be soon, very soon. [Gerschenson] You publicly warned that with this \"soft\" policy toward the people of the Malvinas islands we could wake up one morning with a photograph of oil platforms sailing from London to the South Atlantic. Do you still believe this to be true? [Campora] I said the topic had to be considered firmly in order not to receive any surprises... (silence) [Gerschenson] And if we receive that surprise? [Campora] ...Well... in that case... in sum... it will become part of the earlier evaluations. The minister himself is in charge of the topic and has the evaluation of the process. [Gerschenson] But the minister does not tell his ambassador in London what he is doing with London? [Campora] Yes... well. He personally is handling this matter and he decides. He has decided to give this matter a high priority and his personal effort. [Gerschenson] President Menem said we are going to recover the islands in the year 2000. When do you see the Argentine flag flying over the Malvinas? [Campora] That is futurism. The South Atlantic is an area in which Argentina's presence is progressive. When one looks at the map, one comes to the conclusion that the islands have an undisputable geographical link. There is no other alternative than that of integrating with the continent, and the continent is Argentina, and in addition it has the rights. [Gerschenson] But Menem says that in the year 2000... [Campora] That is a political objective. The Argentine projection foresees the final step of integration with the islands in the year 2000. In sum, in politics anything is possible. [Gerschenson] Did they send the Christmas presents for the Kelpers [preceding word in English] from your embassy? [Campora] No, he [Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella] sent them. [Gerschenson] What was the repercussion on British public opinion regarding the assassinations during the 1982 war? [Campora] This matter is currently in the hands of the Crown's Attorney, and within the next few days we are going to know what is going to be done with Scotland Yard's [preceding two words in English] investigation. [Gerschenson] Then do you agree with the policy being implemented regarding the Malvinas Islands? [Campora] Policy is an instrument that emerges from a higher level than mine, and it is executed by the president and the minister. I am just a subordinate."

            "text": "BFN [Text] According to a DYN news agency dispatch, the Argentine and UK Governments will begin negotiations on possible \"offshore\" oil exploitation around the Malvinas Islands. A special commission has been charged with conducting the talks, which will start on 1 July. Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella will head the Argentine mission. In an interview with DYN, Foreign Ministry Secretary General Andres Cisneros asserted that \"we have agreed to sit down at the negotiating table, to see how we can avoid having future oil exploitation affect the interests of the parties involved.\" He thus alluded to the Argentine-UK controversy over the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands. Cisneros pointed out that in the course of the talks \"Argentina will use all the legal and political resources it has at its disposal to claim its rights before the governments and companies interested in tapping oil in the area.\" Around the end of the year, or at the beginning of 1995, the British Government allegedly intends to license several offshore ventures for hydrocarbons prospecting in the area near the Malvinas Islands. This move is reportedly based on prior studies claiming that the area could be rich in oil and gas. A report drafted and published by the British Geological Survey -- consultants for the Malvinas' British authorities -- argues that recent seismic studies over an area extending 200 square km around the Malvinas Islands revealed the existence of sedimentary basins comparable to the North Sea oil fields (which belong to the United Kingdom). The Argentine Government questions the real perspectives for a feasible exploitation of these resources from an economic standpoint. It has even expressed certain reservations about the interest international companies allegedly have in participating in oil prospecting in the area. The executive branch is nevertheless getting ready to tackle a round of negotiations with the British Government to be held in London and in Buenos Aires, as was decided last year by the High Level Group in charge of conducting bilateral economic and political negotiations under the so-called diplomatic umbrella agreed upon by both parties in 1990, which leaves out the question of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. Cisneros conceded that \"Great Britain continues to show hostility toward Argentina in international forums. The islanders refuse to establish any kind of trade with the only neighbor they have in the world, and react to it as if it were an uncouth and hostile country even though 12 years have already elapsed since the war.\" Cisneros concluded by ruling out the possibility that the United Kingdom might decide to go ahead in the development of an oil prospecting scheme in the Malvinas islands without having reached prior agreement with Argentina."

The scientists want monthly payments of $5,500 (3.63 million real cruzeiros), which are equivalent to the salaries paid to military personnel, and the CNPq is offering $1,700 (1.2 million real cruzeiros). The researchers refused to leave for Antarctica this week as scheduled for a 10-month period at the station, and just eight military officers supplying logistics support for the project traveled. According to Heber Reis Passos, the Trade Union of Federal Servants in the Science and Technology Area director, the problem started when the Navy Ministry, responsible for the entire project during its first eight years, disengaged itself from the research field, which was taken over by the Science and Technology Ministry last year. Following this disengagement, the scientists began to collect their payments as per the CNPq payment schedule for people working abroad, while military personnel continued collecting their payments as per their ministry's payment schedule. Reis said: \"When the researchers saw that they would not receive equal treatment, they refused to leave for Antarctica.\" The EACF currently develops projects on the ozone layer, magnetism, pollution, cosmic rays, and meteorology, among others. Heber Reis believes the absence of scientists during the winter at the Antarctic station might mean an \"irreparable hiatus\" in the program. Reis said: \"The country will lose 10 months of research work, which is absurd.\" CNPq Technological Development Superintendent Guilherme Brandao believes this threat does not exist. He emphasized that the CNPq has contacted researchers who already have been at the station before to replace those who refused to leave for Antarctica. With this, Brandao hopes to minimize the delay's consequences. He emphasized: \"We probably will send a new group within three months on the next support flight.\" [passage omitted]"

            "text": "Language: German Article Type:CSO [Text] Arctic Fusion The ozone hole, the greenhouse effect, and climatic catastrophes continue to bring the Antarctic publicity as a crucible of weather. The fusion achieved between former East and West German polar researchers caused less of a sensation. Polar researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Oceanic Research Bremerhaven made out well during \"ceiling control,\" which in plain English means last year's freeze on national research institute budgets by the BMFT (Federal Ministry for Research and Technology). Mention of their participation in the international Global Change Program, which is aimed at studying global environmental change, protected them from the red pencil. The Germans can make a traditionally significant contribution to tracking down global changes, especially in the Antarctic. In 1976, GDR researchers set up their own research station to study solar-terrestrial relationships in the Schirmacher Oasis in Queen Maud Land, which later was given the name \"Georg Forster.\" After the conclusions of this program, isotope physicists and chemists from Leipzig, geologists from Potsdam, and geomagnetists moved in. The first Federal German station, \"Georg von Neumayer,\" was built in 1981. With the German-German fusion of polar research, the question arose whether and how operation of the stations should be continued. Result: \"Forster\" is being renovated, but in the future it will only be used as a summer base. The budget afforded no more, especially since the old Neumayer station on the Ekstrom shelf ice in western Antarctica had to be given up and replaced by new facilities in 1992. What too seldom works out in other cases went well here. East German polar research was given an exceptionally positive assessment by the Science Council. AWI director Prof. Gotthilf Hempel, chairman of the evaluation committee, even raved about \"a pearl of former GDR Academy research.\" There was no duplication of West German goals. Structurally, of course, there were adjustment problems. Earlier, a maximum of six staff members of the Academy's Central Institute for Geophysics in Potsdam prepared and coordinated the expeditions logistically. Scientists from various institutions carried out the research itself. After unification, it was decided to expand the Potsdam working group to an AWI research center. The staff was increased to 40, 20 of whom are scientists. Corresponding to the marine specialization of the AWI parent institute, continental activities went to the Potsdam group. In addition, atmospheric research using radio-equipped weather balloon ascents, radiation measurements, ozone exploration with lasers, and spectroscopic detection of aerosols are increasingly being undertaken. One group of the Bremerhaven scientists involved with this area has moved to Brandenburg. \"Certainly the long tradition of East German research on the Antarctic atmosphere influenced this decision favorably,\" believes research center director Dr. Hans-Wolfgang Hubberten. GDR scientists, he acknowledges, \"were the first to measure the vertical structure of the ozone hole continuously with balloon probes.\" This longest and most complete series of measurements will be continued in the future at the Neumayer station. \"But aerological investigations as well as total ozone measurements on Spitzbergen will be made and evaluated by us,\" says Hubberten. His goal: To maintain the good image of the Potsdam research center and to polish it up with new ideas and findings."

            "text": "Language: English Article Type:CSO [Article by Nick Nuttall, environment correspondent: \"Ozone Levels Over Britain `Threatening Food Chain'\"] [Text] The Earth's protective ozone is at a record low over Britain and there are fears that the resulting high levels of ultraviolet light could affect pollinating insects and the growth of seedlings. Scientists with the Stratospheric Ozone Review Group said yesterday that despite measures to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals, such as the aerosol gases chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the layer will continue to be destroyed into the early part of next century. By 2005, the levels of ultraviolet light hitting Aberdeen could be equivalent to those in mid-France. Joe Farman, of the European Ozone Research Coordinating Unit and the man who discovered the ozone hole over Antarctica in 1985, said the main threat could be to seedlings and \"pollinating insects at the heart of the food chain.\" He said that to the best of his knowledge no research had been carried out on the links between higher levels of UV and insects such as bees increased levels of ultraviolet light may damage the leaves of seedlings and kill insects by damaging their genetic material. As the ozone layer thins, environmentalists and medical researchers fear that the levels of skin cancer will rise. The UN has predicted that a 10 per cent decrease in the ozone layer will lead to 300,000 more skin cancers a year and 1.75 million cataracts. Dr John Pyle of Cambridge University, chairman of the ozone review group, said this was unlikely, particularly if people took sensible protective measures such as wearing a hat and sun cream. The fifth report of the group, which was set up in 1985 by the Department of the Environment and the Meteorological Office, assesses the results from satellite measurements, aircraft and field work. It finds that between May 1992 and May 1993 the average global thickness of ozone fell by between 2 and 3 per cent. Over northern Europe, however, winter levels of ozone slumped by around 25 per cent between 1991 and 1993. The scientists said the sharp decline was partly due to unusual weather conditions, in particular a strong and persistent anticyclone over the area, and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991. They also said the destruction was triggered by a build-up of chlorine chemicals. Such chemicals, released from products such as aerosols, refrigerants and fire extinguishers, have been shown to be causing the hole over Antarctica, but these are the first firm findings showing they are also damaging ozone over the northern hemisphere. The scientists said that measures under the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs and some other ozone-depleting chemicals by 1996 were working, with concentrations beginning to tail off. Nevertheless, build-ups of breakdown chemicals, the actual ozone killers, will persist into the next century, peaking between 2000 and 2005. This is likely to trigger a 20 to 25 per cent average thinning over Britain and northern Europe since records began in 1979. Dr Pyle said the hole over Antarctica was unlikely to disappear until 2080. The scientists also called on the Government to save Snoopy, the C130 Herculese aircraft operated by the Meteorological Research Flight at Farnham, Hampshire. Last week The Times reported that the plane, which is involved in crucial atmospheric research, was on a Ministry of Defence hit list. While America and Germany are building new research aircraft, Britain will have none if Snoopy goes. Dr Pyle said the aircraft was not only vital for research, but secured Britain a presence in scientific projects of international importance."

            "text": "Language: Russian Article Type:CSO [Article by Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, minister of environmental protection and natural resources, under the heading ``Satisfaction'': ``Response to Persistent Critics: `No Normal Economy Can Be Built Without a Normal Environment'''] [Text] My interview in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (No 251 (675), 30 December 1993) drew an extremely emotional reaction from A. V. Yablokov, the chairman of the Security Council's Interagency Commission on Ecological Safety (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 13 January 1994). Neither I nor anyone else in the environmental protection system was surprised at that reaction -- we have long since become accustomed to Aleksey Vladimirovich's incompetence and emotional outbursts. But I do feel compelled to write to the newspaper again because that incompetence caused the distortion of certain facts that are quite obvious or else easily verifiable, as well as incorrect and subjective interpretation of other facts and such exaggeration that the likelihood of readers being misinformed is simply too great to ignore. Provisionally -- but only provisionally -- one could divide Yablokov's ``response'' into three section: firstly, a description of Russia's ``terrible'' environmental problems, secondly, a tale of how the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, deprived of Mr. Yablokov's skillful leadership, either cannot or will not function and, finally a third section containing assertions of a political nature which clearly reek of denunciation. Let us begin with the most simple fact, and the thing that evidently enrages my opponent most of all: my election as deputy to the State Duma. I was elected on a slate of candidates from the Russia's Choice association, and I was elected in Nizhegorod Electoral District, because the association's slate was divided up into geographical districts, in full compliance with the Election Statute. I did not lose anywhere. Nor did I attempt to register anywhere except in Nizhniy Novgorod. So why did Yablokov not even bother to inquire of the Central Elections Committee exactly how I got elected? And along those same lines, what does the word ``self-appointment'' in the final paragraph of his article mean? Could it be that Yablokov thinks I appointed myself minister? One thing is clear: that kind of mistake is impermissible not only for a politician, but for any state official, even one who stands apart from politics (though at one time Yablokov was active in politics and served as a USSR people's deputy). Now let us turn to ecology and begin with organizational and administrative matters. Unfortunately, at this time it is by no means just the Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources that is responsible for the environment, the state of natural resources and natural resource use in Russia. In addition to it there are at least 11 other federal agencies dealing with those matters, and six of those organizations (the Russian Federation Committee on Fishing, the Ministry of Agriculture's Hunting Department, Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight and the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight) have always been wholly independent of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. Yet Yablokov holds me accountable for all of them. When I talk about the results of our efforts, about our problems, the means of solving them and our capabilities, in the first approximation I am referring to a framework established by current legislative acts. In addition one must also take into account the actual social and economic situation in the country, the things that society will agree to do and the things that it plainly will not accept at this time. Things are very comfortable when the GNP is rising and the centrally distributed portion thereof is increasing -- in that case everyone can be allocated a little bit more, and high-priority areas (environmental protection, for example) can be given more than anyone else. But if the amount of money being distributed is not growing, then one area can only receive something at the expense of another (for example, the pension fund, health care services, education, science, culture, etc.). It is even worse when the GNP and the centrally distributed portion thereof are decreasing. In that case the amount of funding received by each section of the state's budget also decreases, and in order to increase allocations in one area it is necessary to impoverish other areas even more. Add to that the fact that they are already losing money due to the worsening economic situation. One must have exceptionally high priority in the eyes of society to get additional funding under these conditions. But of course Yablokov is aware that the declining standard of living, higher crime rates, unemployment, political problems stemming from the collapse of the Soviet Union and many other things have relegated environmental protection to a place of very low priority in public opinion. Under these conditions one must look at things realistically and ask for whatever society is willing to give. Even if that means taking a purely market-oriented position and framing the issue like this: what is better in terms of improvement in the environment's priority ranking -- constant performance of requiems, or reasoning and information based on the actual functioning of the environmental protection system? I am convinced that the latter is better. Yablokov writes: ``...budgetary funding for the field is such that the entire Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection system is on the verge of collapse.'' As for collapse, that is an outright lie, and just show me anyone whose budgetary funding situation is any better! Without the slightest effort I could name 15 ministries and agencies where things are worse. If the environmental situation were catastrophically bad throughout the entire territory of Russia that would be a death sentence for all of humanity. It is strange that Yablokov has somehow overlooked the biosphere as a whole and the role played in it by our ``golden ecological reserve'' -- the more than one-third of Russia's territory that remains virtually untouched by commercial activity (7-8 million square kilometers). Fortunately, overall this is not yet a catastrophe, it is a problem, and one which can and should be solved. One must not forget that 30 years ago an extremely severe environmental situation was observed in many regions of Europe, the United States and Japan. The situation there often coincided exactly with what we are currently seeing, primarily in metal-manufacturing cities, in Baykalsk and in industrial centers in the Urals and the Volga region. The post-industrial countries have solved this problem, though one must admit that they have done so largely at the expense of the Third World (and the world at large). I am convinced that we will also solve it, and we will attempt to do so not at anyone else's expense, using our own scientific and technical resources, instead of exporting environment-intensive types of production abroad. I have written on many occasions about the fact that that process could begin in Russia together with an economic upturn, that solutions to the problems of the economy and the environment must be implemented simultaneously, that introduction of the new technologies that will allow our economy to lower its overhead and improve its product quality and competitiveness on the world market will at the same time make it possible to achieve radical changes in the interaction between the economy and nature. No, there is no way to build a normal economy without a normal environment. But equally pointless is the position that says first the environment, then the economy. What is needed here is calm calculation, persistent day-to-day efforts to assess and monitor compliance with decisions, environmental inspection, further development of the economic mechanism for environmental protection and natural resource use (which even now is functioning just fine) improvement of the tax system, and development of environmental protection legislation. To many people that seems pretty boring, and most of these are things you would not talk about at a demonstration, for example, but the future of our environment and the ecological health of our country will depend primarily on these efforts. I am surprised by the number of scientific errors constantly made by Yablokov. In what scientific source did he read that there is an ozone hole over the Northern Hemisphere, and over Russia in particular? Over the Antarctic -- yes, there is, or rather there is a hole that appears and disappears depending on seasonal variations. But the only thing that has been recorded over the Northern Hemisphere is a depletion of the ozone layer -- fortunately we still have a long way to go before we have a hole. The causes of this extremely unpleasant phenomenon did not come about in just the past three to five years. Large-scale production of ozone layer-destroying chlorofluorocarbons goes back several decades, and many of them continue to ``live'' in the atmosphere. The effects of those that are already there will only cease several decades from now. Yet reading that particular passage in Yablokov's article the uninformed reader could well think that the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection has through its bungling created an ozone hole in the past two years. Things that can be forgiven an environmentalist speaker addressing a rally are unpardonable coming from a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, just as they are unpardonable coming from a high-level government official. Or consider this excerpt: ``Since the state of the environment is responsible for roughly 30 percent of our health, one year out of the three years of decrease in average life expectance in 1993 is due to the environment.'' But just what is ``30 percent of our health?'' After declaring rates of illness a health factor, Yablokov draws this astounding conclusion: since roughly a third of the reported illness rate is attributable to the environmental factor -- according to him -- then consequently for every three years of decline in life expectancy one year is due to that factor. How can one respond to that? Doctors are well aware that disease rates are not so simply and directly connected with life expectancy, especially if one considers only reported illnesses based on hospital records (as is done in virtually every study). Yablokov seems very prone to mistake his claims for the final authority on truth. In his opinion, the minister ``delayed for more than a year the development of a system of measures stemming from the decisions by the U.N. Conference on Sustainable Development signed by Russia in Rio de Janeiro.'' It is a well-known fact that those decisions were signed by more than 150 countries of the world, and I would like for Yablokov to name me even five that have approved any such systems of measures at the governmental level. The Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection in conjunction with other affected ministries and agencies has in fact submitted a draft plan to the government. Yablokov leveled the same charge at me at a meeting of the government's commission on environmental protection and natural resource use but, as is his custom, did not stay until the end and left the meeting before I was able to reply. For that reason he remains ignorant of the arbitrary nature of his assessment. The Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection complies with all legal standards, laws and sublegal acts and cannot, as an organ of state executive authority, operate in any other way. At the start of this letter, addressing the ministry's tasks, functions and rights, I wrote: ``in the first approximation.'' The second approximation clearly is to consciously and purposefully change guidelines that do not satisfy the environmental protection system, based on consideration of principle and an overall scientific assessment of our tasks and functions. Not to violate the guidelines, but rather to change them, acting within the bounds of the law. We are very dissatisfied with the current ``Statute on the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources'' and have prepared a new version. We have gotten approval for it from all ministries and agencies and we are now waiting for government approval, but unfortunately due to the government's reorganization that approval has been delayed. We are in many ways dissatisfied with the current law ``On Environmental Protection,'' but the we have prepared a draft of a new federal law to be entitled ``On Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development'' and are ready to submit it to the State Duma in the near future. True, if it were not for the parliamentary crisis we would have done so months earlier. All of this adds up to not very favorable conditions surrounding the ministry, but I am not inclined to keep count of our defeats, otherwise one would have to regard the entire history of any ministry as an unbroken series of defeats. These are just difficulties, the kind that are quite normal for any aspect of government work and for any ministry or agency. We do not overly dramatize the situation. We are doing our jobs. Incidentally, a brief report on our work is included in the state reports I have already mentioned, and is submitted to the government on a monthly basis, in addition to our annual report. Yablokov should be familiar with all these materials, it just seems that he has no interest in them. Now a word about the All-Russian Congress on Ecology and Environmental Protection. This is definitely a useful idea, and the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection has been an active supporter of it from the start. But convening a congress without any preparatory work would be absolutely pointless. Major organizational preparations are required. Nor will a program for Russia's ecological revival come about by itself. It will have to be developed. All that takes money, people to do the work and an appropriate organization. At a board meeting of the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection this matter was considered in the presence of Yablokov, who stated that he wanted to be head of the organizing committee that would organize the congress. The embarrassed board members said nothing, and no decision as to who should be assigned to head the organizational committee was made at that time. Firstly, it is a well-known fact that in other countries such events are usually headed by the president, the vice-president or the prime minister, not by an advisor. Secondly, Yablokov does not have any substantial apparatus supporting him, and that means the whole organizational burden would fall on the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection. We are also very familiar with Yablokov's leadership style, and we were simply horrified at the prospect. The Russian delegation to the Rio conference was headed, not too successfully, by A. V. Rutskoy, whose status would be fully appropriate for the head of an organizing committee. As for the assertion that I need ``political closeness to Rutskoy,'' that statement could only elicit laughter from anyone who has the slightest familiarity with the issue. Incidentally, in terms of the ``mournful tone'' of his environmental speeches A. V. Rutskoy has always been very close to A. V. Yablokov. There is a great deal of evidence that I have never sought political closeness to Rutskoy, and Yablokov himself could call some to mind if he would try. Back in the fall of 1992 there was no mention of political battles in connection with the election or anything else of the kind. As for me, I have never betrayed my democratic beliefs and my liberal economic concepts, and there is no way that I can regard Rutskoy as an ally based either on psychological makeup or ideological considerations. As for the assertion that he has no use for me whatsoever, I have never had any doubt about that. Where is the environmental program, Yablokov asks? I have already mentioned it. It is the document that has been submitted for government approval, prepared in accordance with the decisions of the U.N. conference in Rio de Janeiro and the followup conference on ``The Environment for Europe,'' held in Lucerne a year later. The document was completed exactly on schedule. As for why ``our government has avoided further developing and implementing it,'' that is a question that should be addressed to the head of government, not to me. In a postscript to his response to me Yablokov states that he intends to focus his efforts on the Russian Security Council's Interagency Commission on Ecological Safety. Of that commission he writes: ``The commission's decisions... are subject to review by organs of state authority...'' It is obvious that it is precisely authority that attracts A. V. Yablokov, the authority to be irresponsible, and that has always been his position: he has monitored and instructed the ministry and sent it almost 1,000 letters in a year and a half, yet has never been accountable for anything. But he has a very dim concept of how to use authority. The same is true now: I look at his commission's plans and I can see that he will be lucky if one-twentieth of them will ever actually come before the Security Council. All the rest will be just static, another source of annoyance for those who have to implement them, those who will once again be issued tens and hundreds of guidelines to follow. Though head of the Security Council's Interagency Commission, Yablokov is not even clear on how the council functions, which issues it considers and what kind of decisions it makes. In MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI (9-16 January 1994, No 2/699) A. V. Yablokov, commenting on his resignation from the post of presidential advisor, wrote: ``I have not seen the president in the past six months.'' I think the president is right: the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources prepares information and analyses on all environmental issues, so there is no need for any intermediaries. P.S. As this article was being prepared NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (No 13 (689), 21 January 1994) published another letter taking exception to my interview. It had the same hallmarks as the other, i.e. an extremely sloppy handling of facts, rumor-mongering and disregard for the law permeating virtually every line, and these things naturally lead one to conclude that all these opinions stem from a single source."

            "text": "Language: English Article Type:BFN [Christine McGourty report: \"Sea Fails To Soak Up Greenhouse Gases\"] [Text] An ocean process that absorbs 20 per cent of man-made emissions of carbon dioxide has broken down. Oceanographers on a three-month expedition to the Greenland Sea have found a significant reduction in \"deep convection\" -- the process by which the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is transported to the sea bed. Dr. Peter Wadhams of the Scott Polar Research Institute, leader of the expedition, said yesterday the decline was \"disturbing and surprising.\" \"Convection in the Greenland Sea has virtually stopped in the last decade,\" he told Oceanology International, a marine science conference in Brighton. \"It is a process that has been going on for several thousand years and when you see it decline sharply over a decade it gets you worried.\" The process was \"a plughole\" for carbon dioxide and its decline could leave more of the gas in the atmosphere, increasing global warming through the greenhouse effect, he said. It occurs in only four places -- the Greenland Sea, the Labrador Sea, the Weddell Sea in Antarctica and in the western Mediterranean. Dense surface water sinks to the sea bed, taking carbon dioxide with it. Except in the Mediterranean, the process begins when ice sheets expand in the winter. As ice forms, salt is rejected into the water, making it more dense and forcing it deeper. On last year's expedition, oceanographers studied the process at the Odden Ice Tongue -- an unusual ice sheet about 100 miles long and 50 miles wide in the Greenland Sea. \"Convection there is dependent on ice forming,\" said Dr. Wadhams. \"But in recent years not enough ice has been forming.\" This itself could be a result of global warming, he added. Measurements of salinity and temperature taken from the expedition's four research ships showed that convection took place to a depth of only 3,000 feet last year, compared with 6,000 feet five years ago. Ten years ago convection took place all the way down to the sea bed -- 12,000 feet."

            "text": "Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Deputy Industry Minister Phonthep Techaphaibul yesterday urged developed countries which are parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer to help replenish the Multilateral Fund. Financial assistance is essential for developing countries' efforts to phase out their use of ozone-depleting substances, he asserted. The Montreal Protocol is an international agreement on the protection of ozone layer which filters the harmful ultraviolet rays from reaching the earth's surface. K.M. Sarma, Coordinator of the Ozone Secretariat, told participants at the Preparatory Meeting of the Fifth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol--which opened in Bangkok yesterday--that contributions to the Multilateral Fund are still behind pledges. Speaking on behalf of the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Mr. Sarma urged the Governments of the countries which ``could pay but did not pay'' to make their contributions as soon as possible. Mr. Phonthep, in his opening speech, said the provision of adequate funding is important to developing countries constrained by their technologies and financial resources in eliminating the production and consumption of ozone-destroying chemicals. Thailand is listed in the so-called Article 5 Paragraph 1 countries which are eligible for financial assistance from the Multilateral Fund for projects to phase out the use of substances that damage the ozone layer. Mr. Phonthep said the Thai Government has already taken various measures to discourage the use of such substances, including promoting public awareness on the danger of ozone destruction and encouraging people to help save the ozone. Mr. Sarma said the requirements of the Multilateral Fund for 1994, 1995 and 1996 are a vital issue of discussion at the Bangkok meeting. According to Mr. Sarma, it has already been agreed that the requirement for the next three years will be between U.S. $340 and $500 million. He stressed this requirement must be met so developing countries can achieve their goals of phasing out their use of ozone damaging substances as early as posslble. ``The less cash we put in now, the more the consumption of the developing countries will increase.'' ``And ultimately it is the contributors to the Fund who have to bear the burden of the cost of phasing out a much larger quantity of the controlled substances,'' he said. Mr. Sarma said although there have been reports that the Montreal Protocol is working splendidly and that the extent of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), a chief ozone-eating agent, is coming down as control measures take effect, he still did not want the people to be complacent. ``This is not the time to pat ourselves on the back and assume that we have succeeded in our task,'' he said. Mr. Sarma said the news about the ozone layer continues to be depressing. In 1992, the Antarctic hole was at its largest and ozone has been depleted by 60 percent. The destruction was also significant in the northern latitudes. In 1993, the record low ozone values over Antarctica reported in September were the lowest ever reported for that month. These values have continued into early October, he said."

            "text": "Language: English Article Type:BFN [Article by S. Karnevi and E. Dean: \"Envisat's Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar: ASAR\"] [Text] An advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) has been selected as the imaging radar sensor for the Envisat-1 payload. In addition to providing continuity of data with the single-swath, single-polarisation Active Microwave Instrumentation (AMI) currently flying on ERS-1 (and ERS-2), the ASAR has the additional advantages of offering: greater coverage, with more flexibility in the choice of swath positions, a wider range of incidence angles, and a wide swath capability; dual polarisation; and improved wave mode capabilities. ASAR'S Role The objectives for the Advanced SAR are very similar to those of the AMI on ERS-1 and ERS-2. The main task will again be that of monitoring the Earth's environment to collect more precise information on global change, focussing specifically on global climate and all of the factors that may influence it. Monitoring of the Earth's bio-mass, especially the deforestation in the large primeval forests in the equatorial regions, will allow better modelling of the influence on the greenhouse effect and global climate and facilitate the implementation of countermeasures. Desertification and the distribution of humidity, changes in water levels, flooded areas, and the extent of the ice caps around the North and South Poles are other major factors that need to be monitored in order to improve our understanding of global climate change. Envisat's SAR images will also further improve our understanding of ocean dynamics, the interactions between oceans and atmosphere, as well as both manmade and natural processes in coastal zones. The major advantage of using a SAR for earth-observation tasks lies in its ability to acquire imagery day or night and independent of cloud cover and weather conditions. This weather-independent capability is of vital importance for disaster assessment, as major floods or large oil spills, usually occur in weather conditions that drastically curtail the usefulness of optical sensors. ERS-1 SAR images have also proved extremely useful for shipping operations in Arctic ice. Ocean-wave spectra taken around the globe with ASAR will further improve the safety of shipping routes and offshore activities. As experience with SAR data grows, its contribution to resource management will also become more and more important. In addition to the bio-mass estimating application already mentioned, improved classification methods will allow more accurate harvest predictions, better estimates of sweet-water resources and, via geological surveys, support the search for mineral resources. The ASAR Instrument Given the rapid expansion in the SAR data user community, it is essential that Envisat should carry an instrument that not only provides data continuity with ERS-1 and ERS-2, but also at the same time represents a step forward in terms of both system flexibility and the scientific and operational value of its data sets. To satisfy these needs, the ASAR design incorporates: -- A flexible swath-position capability, which will offer the choice between several image swath positions at various distances from the subsatellite track with different incidence angles. -- A dual-polarisation facility (cf. vertical only on ERS), offering horizontal or vertical polarisation imaging. The ASAR's ability to switch between different swaths offers very fast multiplexing, so that an overall swath more than 400 km wide can be imaged in one pass. In addition to this so-called \"Wide Swath Mode\", the ASAR can be set to operate at a coarse spatial resolution of only 1000 m. The data rate will then be low enough for tape recording onboard the spacecraft. This is known as the \"Global Monitoring Mode\" and it constitutes a tool for monitoring such features as ice coverage, snow coverage, deforestation, desertification or humidity, without interruption and on a global scale, due to its independence from ground-station coverage. The ASAR's ability to switch between two polarisation allows a special \"Alternating Polarisation Mode\" to be implemented which permits half of the looks at a scene to be acquired with a horizontal, and the other half with a vertical polarisation in a single pass, thereby considerably increasing the target classification capability (especially if used in conjunction with multi-temporal imaging of the same scene). Furthermore ASAR will, like ERS, have a \"Wave Mode\" for taking 5 x 5 km images but more frequently, over 100 or 200 km distances, and with two such images in any swath over the oceans, to supply ocean-wave spectra on a global basis. The ASAR instrument is divided functionally into two sub-assemblies: -- An Antenna Sub-Assembly (ASA), containing the phased-array antenna electronics distributed over 20 \"tiles\", and -- A Central Electronics Sub-Assembly (CESA), providing signal (RF) generation and reception, control signals, power conditioning and data formatting. The ASAR antenna consists of five hinged panels, each containing four tiles. The CESA equipment units are mounted on three of the Payload Equipment Bay panels inside the spacecraft. Control of the instrument covers the following functions: -- Selecting the required mode and generating the appropriate timeline. -- Selecting the required antenna beam pattern for the required swath (or beam patterns in modes where multiple swaths are needed). -- Housekeeping, including setting redundancy paths. -- Monitoring the status of all equipment. -- Patching and dumping any software. Control is maintained by sending macro-commands via the onboard computer to the Instrument Control Unit (ICU). Instrument Performance The ASAR instrument has several operating modes, which can be grouped into four areas: -- Support modes -- Operational modes -- Calibration modes -- Test/health-check modes. The various roles are summarised in Table 1. Table 1. ASAR operating modes Support modes Off Instrument electrically disconnected from the platform Standby Instrument communications active and capable of receiving Commands and transmitting telemetry on demand. The internal monitoring system is active Heater Ovens of all units requiring temperature stabilisation are active and stable Pre-operation All units are active, but no transmissions are occurring Operation modes Wide swath This mode operates with wide swath and reduced spatial resolution Image High resolution, selectable swath position Wave Sampled imaging mode, low data rate Global monitoring Wide swath, low spatial resolution, low data rate Alternating polarisation Interleaved vertically and horizontally polarised (VV and HH) imaging at high resolution, selectable swath position Calibration modes External calibration External characterisation to ground receivers Test/Health-check modes Module stepping Individual health check on each T/R module Test On-ground testing facility The operational modes can themselves be divided into three different categories: -- High-spatial-resolution imaging modes -- Low-spatial-resolution imaging modes -- Wave mode. High-spatial-resolution Imaging Modes In these two modes - the so-called \"Image Mode\" and \"Alternating Polarisation Mode\" - the ASAR operates as an imaging radar with high spatial resolution (typically a few tens of metres), and relatively narrow swaths (up to 120 km). The Image Mode provides continuous coverage over a single swath nominally 100 km wide. The swath can be selected anywhere within a 500 km region (incidence angle range 15-45 degrees). For nominal operation, seven swaths (IS1 to IS7) are defined over this region. The imaging is performed by transmitting a continuous series of pulses and acquiring the required echo information after the appropriate return trip delay. The transition to Image Mode is made automatically following the appropriate macro-command. Before the actual measurement of data is initiated, a period of stabilisation, noise measurement and internal calibration is performed. Echo measurement then starts, during which the initial calibration is updated on a regular basis. Image Mode operation continues uninterrupted until the receipt of another macro-command to switch to another mode. The Alternating Polarisation Mode provides vertically and horizontally polarised imaging of the same scene by interleaving looks with each polarisation along track within the synthetic aperture. The echo measurement is made within repetition cycles containing two bursts of transmissions on each of the polarisations. The sequence is only interrupted when the internal calibration requires updating (as for the Image Mode). Low-Spatial-Resolution Imaging Modes These are the \"Wide Swath Mode\" and \"Global Monitoring Mode\", in which the ASAR operates as an imaging radar with low spatial resolution (100 m to 1 km) and relatively wide swath (more than 400 km). To obtain global coverage for the Global Monitoring Mode, the data is stored onboard the satellite and transferred to ground when it passes over a ground station. The Wide Swath Mode provides continuous coverage over a swath nominally 400 km wide, which is divided into five subswaths ranging from 60 to 100 km in width. The ASAR transmits bursts of pulses to each of the subswaths in turn in such a way that a continuous along-track image is built up for each subswath. During a transition to Wide Swath Mode, all the necessary data transfers and timing parameters are established. Stabilisation, noise measurement and internal calibration follow in a similar manner to the Image Mode, after which the echo measurement sequence itself commences. For each subswath, there is a burst of transmissions followed by a short quiescent period whilst the echoes from the last transmit pulses are received. Transmissions then switch to the next subswath in the cycle. The updating of the internal calibration is performed at the end of each subswath transmission burst. The Global Monitoring Mode provides continuous along-track sampling across a 400 km swath, again using a SAR scanning technique. This mode has a low data rate due to a slightly reduced along-track duty ratio and the use of digital filtering for reduction in the across-track direction. The same subswaths as defined for the Wide Swath Mode are used. Wave Mode In the \"Wave Mode\", the ASAR uses the facilities of the Image Mode to image small areas of the ocean surface, measuring the changes in radar backscatter from the surface due to wave action. The imaging is carried out to a high spatial resolution over one or two areas across a swath of approximately 5 km x 5 km at intervals of nominally 100 or 200 km in the along-track direction. The transition to Wave Mode is identical to that for the Image Mode, including the initial calibration sequence. This is followed by a burst of transmissions covering the 5 km along-track vignette distance. A quiescent period is then used to transfer the data to the Payload Data Handling and Transmission System via the low-rate data interface. The total duration of the repetition cycle is the time taken to traverse the 100 or 200 km separation between vignettes. Noise and calibration sequences are repeated at the start of each cycle. The predicted in-orbit performances of the ASAR instrument in its various modes of operation are presented in Table 2. The instrument is still in the development stage and its final performance parameters will be established as part of the Preliminary Design Review, scheduled for early 1994. Table 2.

The products will fall into four main categories: -- High-Resolution Images, generated within 24 h of sensing and normally distributed by non-electronic means, similar to the ERS-1 Precision Image (PRI). -- Fast-Delivery Products, delivered within 3 h of sensing via electronic links; this product will have a lower geometric resolution (approx. 100 m pixels). -- Browse Products, delivered within 3 h, but with very low resolution, and used for Browse Catalogues. -- Wave Imagettes and Spectra, similar to the ERS-1 wave spectra, but with the ASAR enhancements. Conclusion In addition to achieving comparable performance to ERS-1 in the swath that coincides with the ERS-1 single fixed swath, the ASAR instrument will give Envisat-1: -- Wider swath and incidence-angle coverage -- A second channel of information by means of the dual- polarisation capability -- Variable spatial resolutions and data rates. In addition, the ASAR can be tuned during its in-orbit lifetime to make optimum use of the power available. Satellite instrument designs are generally driven by end-of-life requirements, which often results in under-utilisation early in a mission. The ASAR's built-in flexibility will allow it to take advantage of beginning-of-life conditions. It will also enable operating modes other than the baseline modes that were identified in Table 1 to be explored during the Envisat-1 mission, thereby helping to define requirements and modes of operation for future SAR missions."

            "text": "Language: English Article Type:CSO [Text] Earth observation by satellite was started in 1978, when Earth Observation Center (EOC) of the NASDA (National Space Development Agency of Japan) was set up in Saitama Prefecture, just north of Tokyo, and started receiving data from the American LANDSAT satellite. The history of Japanese remote sensing had really begun. In 1987, the reception of data from the Japanese Marine Observation Satellite (MOS-1) was started. This was followed by reception of data from the French earth observation satellite SPOT in 1988, from MOS-1b in 1990, from the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1) in 1991 and from the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) in 1992. At present, data are being regularly received from six Japanese and foreign earth observation satellites at EOC. The earth observing data is steadily increasing and becoming completely. [sentence as printed] Earth observation by satellites has been steadily promoted, because the observation by satellites is better than other observation methods to cover wide area of earth and make regular observations in a long term. Satellite observing data have been mainly used to survey land use, farm crops and to monitor active volcanoes in disaster prevention. In addition to the above, Japan, Europe and the United States have been promoting projects to use satellites to monitor the conditions of the global environment as the interest in earth environment problems has mounted in recent years. Under these circumstances, Japan is operating or is developing the following earth observation satellites: Marine Observation Satellite MOS-1/1b MOS-1 whose main object is the global marine observation carries three observation sensors: a Multi-Spectral Electric Self-Scanning Radiometer (MESSR) for detailed observation of land and ocean areas, a Visible and Thermal Infrared Radiometer (VTIR) to monitor clouds and sea surface temperature, and a Microwave Scanning Radiometer (MSR) to observe the sea surface, moisture in the atmosphere, ice on the sea, snowfall, etc. MOS-1 was launched into Sun Synchronous Subrecurrent at an altitude of about 900 kilometers in February 1987, and MOS-1b, which is the successor of MOS-1, was launched in February 1990. Both MOS-1 and MOS-1b are still in operation and are sending large volumes of precious earth observation data. Japanese Earth Resources Satellite, JERS-1 JERS-1 is principally designed to survey resources, and it also conducts earth observations to help land surveying, agriculture, fisheries, preservation of the environment, disaster prevention and coastal watching. This satellite also has the mission to develop a high-level earth observation system. JERS-1 carries Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) which is capable of making a detailed observation of land surfaces, regardless of day or night or weather condition, by transmitting microwaves and detecting the reflection on the land surface, functioning in a similar way to radar on the plane. JERS-1 is also equipped with Optical Sensor (OPS) which have the capacity to survey resources and obtain marine information with an improved version of MESSR on MOS-1 and also make precise, three-dimensional shapes of land surface by combining the data obtained with two kinds of functions. This satellite was launched in February 1992 into Sun Synchronous Subrecurrent at an altitude of approximately 570 kilometers and is now gathering data which is useful mainly in the surveying of natural resources. Advanced Earth Observing Satellite, ADEOS ADEOS is designed to make an international contribution by monitoring global-scale changes in conditions of the earth environment. ADEOS is also designed to develop the platform technology necessary for the development of future satellites and relaying of data obtained by earth observation satellites. ADEOS is to be mounted with the Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (OCTS) which has the ability to monitor the basic productivity of the ocean on a global scale and ocean currents by observing ocean color and temperature at high frequency and with high sensitivity. OCTS uses numerical observation wavelengths in the visible as well as infrared ranges. It is also being planned that ADEOS will carry an Advanced Visible and Near-Infrared Radiometer (AVNIR) which will contribute to environment monitoring by acquiring data on plants and ground conditions through observation mainly of land and coastal areas. The observation is to be made by using observation wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared ranges and with high definition. The satellite is also to carry five sensors, two of which are from Japan, two from America and one from France. These sensors will observe wind direction above the ocean, ozone volume and the greenhouse effect gases of earth environmental problems. This satellite is scheduled to be launched into Sun Synchronous Subrecurrent at an altitude of about 800 kilometers in the winter of 1996. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, TRMM The aim of TRMM is to obtain data by satellite on the intensity and location of rainfall in tropical areas. Such data are important to research the environment changes and global climate changes. This satellite is the Japan-U.S. cooperation project. Japan's NASDA will be in charge of developing a rainfall observing radar system and launching the satellite, using an H-II rocket, while the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will develop the satellite bus and observation equipment other than the rainfall radar and operate the satellite, using a data relaying satellite. Japan is already developing a Precipitation Radar (PR) to observe the three-dimensional conditions of tropical rainfall, the rain's vertical condition in particular, and the amount of rainfall on the ocean and the land. Such data are important for investigating the energy cycle of the tropical regions that seriously effect the global environmental change. To be developed in the United States are the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) to be operated jointly with the PR, Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and a Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS). These sensors will all be mounted on the satellite. TRMM is scheduled to be launched into Circular Orbit at an altitude of approximately 350 kilometers in the summer of 1997. Geostationary Meteorological Satellite GMS Series The Geostationary Meteorological Satellite, GMS, Series are earth observation satellites for use in Japan's weather prediction and other climate research. The first GMS was launched in 1977, followed by the GMS-2 in 1981, the GMS-3 in 1983 and the GMS-4 in 1989. They have been in operation for weather prediction and other climate researches. The GMS is first launched into geostationary orbits and is spun at 100 times per minute for stability. The satellite scans the earth surface from west to east using this rotation. GMS-5 is scheduled to be launched in the summer of 1994 for succeeding to the GMS-4 mission. Japan's earth observation satellites have thus been used across a broad range, including weather prediction and disaster prevention, fields closely related to daily life, and earth environment monitoring, a matter of importance to all mankind. The Science and Technology Agency has just completed the reports of the long-term scenario of Japan's earth observation satellites until 2010, which are including the satellites and ground systems developing plan, and the use of earth observation satellites for purposes other than global environment observation. Based on this report, Japan is expected to promote the use of satellite data that have not been fully utilized yet and continue to develop new earth observation satellites in coordination with the earth observation satellite projects of foreign countries."

            "text": "Language: English Article Type:CSO [Text] The Beginnings of Earth Observation The history of earth observation with satellites began with mankind's first satellite, Sputnik-1, launched by the former USSR in 1957. Following on from this, the United States and the former USSR, sent up satellites one after another. Amongst these early satellites, Explorer-6, launched by the United States in 1959 was a breakthrough for earth observation. It was the first satellite to photograph the Earth from space. In the same year, the former USSR used a satellite to photograph the dark side of the moon for the first time. The next big leap was to be in 1961, when Vostok-1, the first manned space ship, was launched by the former USSR. Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on board this primitive space ship was the first man in space, a tremendous step in man's history. Scores of astronauts have since that time had the opportunity to realize the beauty of the Earth and the frail thinness of the layers of Earth's life-supporting atmosphere. Manned satellites gave us a new viewpoint of our planet. The first earth observation satellite, LANDSAT-1, was launched by the United States in 1972. This was followed by another five LANDSATs. Out of these, two, LANDSAT-4 and LANDSAT-5, are still in operation. In the latter half of the 1970's, the two superpowers were joined by a new face. Japan started earth observation in earnest at this time. Japan's Earth Observation Five years after LANDSAT-1, in 1977, Japan launched a geostationary meteorological satellite called Himawari-1. This satellite was put in operation and run by the Meteorological Agency the following year. In 1978, the Earth Observation Center of the National Space Development Agency was established in Saitama Prefecture, north of Tokyo. Initially, the center was set up to receive and record data from LANDSAT-2 and LANDSAT-3. This function still continues to the present day. The data were used to make composite photographs of the Japanese landmass and sales of photographs to users started. The Earth Observation Center continued to expand developing its initial functions until it became the key organ for earth observation that it is today. Meanwhile, four satellites in the Himawari series have been launched so far. The data from the Himawari satellites are utilized mainly by the Meteorological Agency for the prediction of adverse weather conditions such as typhoons and heavy rain and snowfall in addition to normal weather forecasting. The images taken by Himawari appear in TV weather forecasts and weather columns in newspapers. TV stations also compose the images and use computer graphics to superimpose cloud movements when typhoons approach and so on. Such weather information is now a vital part of everyday life. The first marine observation satellite Momo-1 was launched in 1987, ten years after the Himawari-1. This was followed by Momo-1b, which was mounted with the same observation equipment as that of Momo-1, in 1990. The 1b unit has the same orbit as Momo-1 and is set at an angle of 180 degrees. The purpose of developing the marine observation satellite No. 1 was to establish the basic technology needed to make earth observation satellites. This task included development of observation equipment to be mounted on the Momo-1, confirmation of the functions of the equipment and use of the equipment to make experimental observations of the Earth. Momo-1 carries three kinds of equipment to observe the following: --Distribution of plants, situation of land utilization, geological features, distribution of snow on land, disaster prevention, etc. --Water temperature on sea surface, conditions of ocean currents, red tide, conditions of water contamination, etc. --Volumeof vapor in atmosphere, ice floes, snow on ground, etc. In addition, Momo-1 has a function to collect data from buoys floating on the ocean and a basic experiment was also carried out using this system. After completing its initially scheduled two-year service with no malfunction, Momo-1 is still in operation. The satellite Momo-1b, as a successor to the Momo-1, is continuing to observe the ocean, in particular, and the whole Earth. The most recent in the series is the earth resources satellite Fuyo-1, which was launched last year. Fuyo-1 was developed in order to evolve observation equipment, including a high-performance radar, to confirm the functions of the equipment and establish a comprehensive system for earth resources observation. Fuyo-1's main purpose is to probe resources, but the satellite also serves to survey national land and observe the conditions of agriculture, forestry and fisheries and environmental preservation, to prevent disasters and to keep a watch on coastal waters. The observation equipment on board the Momo-1 is capable of checking the undulations and inclinations of land surfaces even under rainy conditions and at night. It is also able to observe land shapes in three dimensions and distinguish rocks, minerals, etc. Japan's earth observation technology is thus shifting from an experimental stage to a stage of new development, in which the technology is widely recognized as effective. It will soon become important for Japan to show what she can offer to international society. Future Plans Under development now are the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). ADEOS is designed to succeed the marine observation satellite and the earth resources satellite to continue collection of data in earth observation. The development of ADEOS is also aimed at developing new technology that will be required in order to develop future earth observation satellites. A total of eight kinds of observation equipment, of which two will be supplied by the National Space Development Agency and six will be selected from among those offered generally, will be mounted on ADEOS. The function of this equipment is to observe the marine climate, the ozone layer, etc. The following are the missions for NASDA's two observation apparatuses: --Frequent acquisition of data on water color and water temperature of oceans and detection of chlorophyll density, floating materials and dissolved substances. (These missions will give data on the volume of substances produced by marine activities, the mechanism of the circulation of carbon dioxide gas and conditions for fishing operations.) --Observation of land and coastal waters and surveys of the destruction of tropical forests, desertification and water contamination. The equipment will also be able to serve in surveys of land use and to probe resources. TRMM will make observations on global-scale climatic changes, such as the El Nino phenomenon and desertification. To solve the mystery of climatic changes, it is necessary to make comprehensive observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land over a long period of time. It is particularly important to observe the circulation of water and energy (heat). For this reason TRMM will observe rainfall and radiation of heat from the ground surface. These observations should be conducted on a global scale, but special emphasis will be placed on the tropical regions, because two-thirds of the rainfall on the earth occurs there. The TRMM project is being jointly promoted by Japan and the United States. On this side, NASDA of Japan is to launch the satellite with an H-II rocket and to develop radar apparatus for rainfall observation, while NASA in the United States is to develop the main body of the satellite and the remaining observation equipment. The United States is also in charge of operating TRMM after its launch, using a data relay satellite. Two further satellites, ADEOS-II and High Resolution Observation Satellite, HIROS are under development. They will be launched to succeed the above satellites in operation and continue to collect data and to improve observation functions. ADEOS-II will be launched in 1999 mainly to conduct global-scale earth observation as a successor to ADEOS. HIROS will be utilized for map drawing and disaster prevention, as it is capable of gathering detailed information. Its launch is scheduled for the year 2000. Postscript The technology for earth observation is thus about to enter a mature stage. The important issue from now will be how to make use of it, using the given means. The following are some of the expected applications: (i) Use of satellites for weather forecasting and other activities which directly affects peoples' daily lives (ii) To serve in national land development, covering agriculture, fisheries, urban development, etc., and to probe resources (iii) To watch for disasters and enable effective countermeasures (iv) To understand what is happening on the Earth and to enrich man's fund of useful knowledge (v) To balance the development and preservation of environment. To use satellites to find the most effective method to solve earth environmental problems, by warning the need to curb human activities, etc. It is important today to widen the fields in which satellite data are effectively used and to expand the data utilization volume. It is necessary to gain a solid recognition of Japan's earth observation efforts from not only Japanese people, but also from the peoples of the world."

Grankov, Radio Engineering and Electronics Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 551.463:629.78] [Abstract] In an earlier study by the author (ZHURN TEKHN. FIZIKI, Vol 60, No 10, pp 114-120, 1990) it is proposed that the position of the sensitivity maximum of the radiation field to OST (ocean surface temperature) be used instead of radio emission intensity as a quantitative OST characteristic. The effectiveness of the proposed microwave spectrometer method for determining OST in the presence of waves and cloud cover is analyzed on the basis of the dependence of OST of a calm water surface on the position of the spectral sensitivity maximum of the field of natural microwave radiation to OST variations. With variation of OST in the range of natural variability of the world ocean (from 0 to 30) the parameter _l_[.sup]m[/] (wavelength) changes from 8.5 to 3.5 cm respectively. The limiting heights of waves and cloud cover densities within which the method retains stability and ensures the required accuracy are determined. Tabulated data show that the microwave spectrometer method, applied in the form of a very simple algorithm, when the wind speed is up to 5-7 m/s has an accuracy in determining OST of about 1C. An improved method is proposed which makes it possible to double or triple the range of meteorological conditions within which the error in determining OST does not exceed 1C. The presence of well-developed cloud cover and foam formation on the water surface causes a considerable increase in the error in determining OST. Ocean areas with such conditions must be excluded from further examination or subjected to more complex processing. Figures 3; references: 6 Russian."

Rodionova, Radio Engineering and Electronics Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 528.852.8] [Abstract] In image analysis important information on a feature is frequently contained in its boundaries. In many cases for the identification of a feature it is sufficient to analyze only its contour image, as first proposed by P. V. C. Hough. The Hough transform is effective in the secondary processing of radar images and this is illustrated in the example of identification of linear features. The Hough transform is applicable in many such problems, such as in remote prospecting for minerals and detection of the tracks of ships on radar images and distinguishing the tracks of ships from other linear oceanic features created by submarine topography and also in detecting ship size and its direction and speed of movement. However, emphasis here is on detection of a moving point target against the background of strong noise. The tracks of targets moving at a constant velocity are straight lines which can be detected using the Hough transform. The motion and direction of the target track, as well as the current position of the target, can be determined by this method. The principal advantage of use of this transform is its relative insensitivity to noise and gaps in contours. Matrix processors for performing the Hough transform with parallel processing on an on-line basis usable in both surface systems for processing images and aboard satellites have now been developed.

            "text": "Language: Russian Article Type:CSO [Article by V. V. Alaverdov, Yu. N. Koptev, V. I. Lukyashchenko, V. P. Senkevich, V. F. Utkin, Russian Space Agency, Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building: \"Russia in Space: This Decade\"] [Text] Space Exploration in the World and in Our Country The twentieth century brought many extraordinary events, and one of the greatest events was mankind's going beyond the bounds of Earth. Time will pass, and much will be forgotten, but the first manned flights into space will always be remembered. In an unusually short period of time, space exploration has become an area of concentration of the latest achievements of mankind, the apex of scientific-technical progress, and a powerful practical means for solving the most varied of problems, problems that are often of a global scale. Now the space program is making a very real contribution to the economy and culture, and it is playing an essential role in securing the safety of the state, in disseminating information to society, in monitoring the environment, and in solving vitally important social problems. In the first decade of the space age, only the USSR and the United States had a space potential of their own that made it possible to effect the entire cycle from development and launch of space vehicles to the practical use of results; now 17 countries are launching their own satellites, and, by 1995, that number is expected to grow to 20-25. In all, though, more than 130 countries participate in space activity either directly or indirectly. Our space program right now is undergoing profound reform, as is the entire economy of the country. The reform of the space sector entails primarily the development of a new concept and a long-term policy and program for Russia's space activity, plus the realization of new economic relations, a defense doctrine, and the interests of domestic and foreign consumers, including the states of the CIS. In the process, it is vitally important that the space- related scientific-technical and intellectual potential that has been created be preserved and be used effectively. Legislation regulating space activity also needs to be enacted. The year 1992 was a difficult year for our space program. Because of the sharp drop in orders for space hardware, space-industry enterprises and organizations found themselves in a very difficult financial position, and space research became unprofitable. The reorientation and shutdown of specialized plants for space hardware got under way. The ties that were in place are still being severed to this day, and the danger of losing state-of-the-art technologies and a substantial number of highly skilled specialists has not disappeared. All that, plus the hundredfold rise in prices for rocket fuel, electronics, metals, and energy carriers, is leading to the curtailment of space activity in our country. In addition, the scaling down of the armed forces in Russia has resulted in a problem with the personnel who used to support the functioning and maintenance of the ground-based infrastructure used in the civilian space programs. With the existence of those acute conditions, the government and the Supreme Soviet of Russia have made decisions that are important to the space program. In the law on the budget system of the Russian Federation for 1992 and 1993, spending for the State Space Program was given a separate line for the first time ever, and the average wage in the space industry is to increase in 1993 to the average level for workers of all of Russian industry. Special agencies for the state management of space activity have been formed in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan for the purpose of setting up cooperation and interaction among the space organizations of the countries of the CIS. A legal basis is being created for effecting joint space activity in the CIS countries that is vigorous, mutually beneficial, and equitable. Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine have all expressed a desire to participate in cooperative interstate space activity. Finally, the publication of a new concept of state space activity serves as an important landmark in the development of our space program. In 1992, the Russian Space Agency [RKA] and the Russian Ministry of Defense -- along with the Russian Academy of Sciences and the environmental, communications, health care, science, and transportation ministries, as well as other concerned departments -- created the State Space Program for the Period up to the Year 2000, which defines the chief goals and most important objectives of the space activity of our country. In it, priority is given to projects that facilitate the growth of the space program, introduce leading technologies, and help to solve the most important socioeconomic problems of Russia. The program aims at producing a practical return in such vitally important areas as information transfer, power engineering, ecology, and raw-material resources. It also takes into consideration the country's international obligations. The first steps in this direction have already been taken. Among the new consumers of space products and services are the Central Bank of Russia, other banks of Russia, and various commercial structures. With the help of Russian commercial organizations, more than 20 space projects involving communications and telecommunications are already under development. Among the clients for those space projects are such large organizations as the Informkosmos Association, the Energiyamarafon Association, the international innovations-related joint venture Koskon, and the joint-stock companies Global Information Systems, Kuryer [Courier], Gazkom, Sokol, Koss, and Ural-Kosmos. Today, Russian businessmen are already capable of carrying out such complex projects as the 1992 space-vehicle flight called Europe-America 500. The program calls for considerable money to be spent for applied space operations, military activity, and science-related space research. Let us examine in more detail which of those projects have received the go-ahead and how the face of our country's space program will look by the end of this decade. Space Communications, Television, and Relay of Information At present, more than 30 communications satellites, as well as 50 main ground stations and 7,500 auxiliary ground stations for space communications, are in continuous operation in Russia for the direct exchange of international television programs. Nationwide city-to-city communications, as well as high-quality international communications, have been set up across the entirety of the CIS. In addition, our country is leasing satellite-based communications and television channels to a number of foreign countries. In the near future, plans call for the stage-by-stage organization of communications via satellite with mobile facilities -- airplanes, ships, and automobiles -- and the offering of the services of satellite-based electronic mail and vehicle-to-vehicle exchange. All of Russia and the CIS will be covered by multiprogram television broadcasting. Plans also call for considerable expansion of the telephone channels for stationary users (so-called fixed communications). The currently existing system for such communications, Potok-SV, uses Gorizont satellites placed at 10 points in geostationary orbit and the ground stations Azimut, Orbita, Zevs, Nauka, and Pikhta. In addition to providing 2,500 telephone channels, it feeds the first television program to the Moskva network of stations and 3-4 channels of mobile communications. Unfortunately, because the orbital inclination cannot be corrected, the Gorizont satellites, by the end of the third year of their operation, shift 2 in latitude, which exceeds the geostationary-satellite position norms allowed by the International Telecommunications Union, and they must be taken off line immediately. Plans call for the development and building by 1995 of an upgraded Ekspress satellite operating in the range of 4/6 GHz, with a traffic capacity that is 1.5- to twofold greater and a more advanced system for control and correction of orbit (the program will be implemented by the Russian Space Agency, the Russian Ministry of Communications, and commercial structures). Those satellites will gradually replace the Gorizont vehicles and will occupy three additional backup points in stationary orbit. Also expected is the creation, by 1997, on the basis of that same equipment, of the Ekspress-M satellite, which operates in the 11-14 GHz range, with a traffic capacity four- to fivefold greater than that of the Gorizont satellite. The implementation of that program will reduce the needs for channels of fixed and nationwide communications by fivefold. For setting up mobile communications (primarily, in the interests of the merchant marine), one channel of the Gorizont satellite relay is now used, which satisfies only 10 percent of the needs for such communications. The Program calls for the creation of a separate communications system, Marafon, on the basis of the geostationary Arkos satellites and the highly elliptical-orbit Mayak satellites. The work will be done in the context of conversion with, by and large, commercial-structure money and the use of well-developed designs. In addition to the highly elliptical-orbit satellites, a system of communications and electronic mail, Gonets, is being developed to set up mobile communications in the 1.5/1.6 GHz and 0.2/0.4 GHz ranges; also under development is the Koskom system, which makes it possible to use middle-orbit satellites to provide direct access to satellite communications channels. The Ukrainian AssoUniti Association for High-Level Technologies is developing a project for a system of personal communications, Ariadna. The RKA is coordinating that work and the support of efficient use of space-infrastructure hardware and facilities and the allocated radio-engineering resources. At present, satellite television broadcasting is provided to Russia and the other countries of the CIS by the Ekran system, which is based on two Ekran-M1 spacecraft (in the 0.7 GHz range, the signal goes to a network of simplified receiving stations), as well as by the Potok-SV system, which is based on several Gorizont satellites (the signal is transmitted in the 4 GHz range to a network of Moskva and Orbita stations). Plans call for the creation of the Gals satellites for the transfer of satellite-based television broadcasting in the 12 GHz range, which has been allocated by the world community for those purposes; after Gals will come Gals-R and Gelikon, with the number of TV channels increased to seven from three. The implementation of the above-enumerated projects will make it possible to solve almost completely the problem of setting up multiprogram zonal television broadcasting for the countries of the CIS and to provide regional television broadcasting in ethnic languages. The programs involving space-based television broadcasting will be funded by the Russian Ministry of Communications, the RKA, the Ostankino TV and radio company, and commercial structures, with proportionate participation by the CIS states. Space Systems for Remote Sensing The hardware projects in this area that are called for by the Program could become the basis for an integrated domestic system for global observation of the environment, natural resource use, and city planning. Unmanned space vehicles in systems of remote sensing and space-based monitoring are already being used to compile thematic natural-resource maps and to assess hydrological reserves, land conditions, and ice conditions; to perform ecological monitoring of the Earth's surface and atmosphere; to identify areas of the World Ocean that are abundant with fish; and to do much more. Those kinds of information are very promising in commercial terms, too. For the successful conduct of operations in cartography and in studies of natural resources and the environment -- to include requests made by foreign consumers -- use of the Resurs-F1 and Resurs-F2 photographic complexes will continue, as will conversion of the Oblik military system to meet national-economy needs. After the Nika-Kuban complex has been built, the effectiveness of photo observation will be raised, with the number of launches cut two- to threefold. Day-to-day observations of land and sea for purposes of pinpointing pollution sources, monitoring ice conditions, and identifying natural features will be provided by the experimental use of the Resurs-01 and Okean-01 complexes. For purposes of expanding the range of solvable problems and raising the quality of observations, the Okean-0 complex for daily observation of the ocean has been developed and is being built; Okean-0 is now part of the Ukrainian space program. Completion of the building, however, requires that organizational, economic, and technical problems associated with the interaction of the space programs of the CIS countries be solved. Some of the tasks facing that complex could be performed with the gear of the Almaz-1 complex, which is capable of performing daily high-definition, all-weather observation of the Earth's surface. It has been decided to develop complexes for daily observation of land and sea on the basis of competitive projects. The development of the Resurs-02 program has been completed, the complex having an expanded set of onboard gear that enables daily land observation with a resolution of down to 2-5 m (resolution now is about 45 m); the Resurs-Spektr project has also been completed. The Priroda module for the orbital station Mir is being built, as are a number of vehicles that are in the conversion program and are intended for solution of peacetime problems. Space-Based Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring The State Space Program of Russia calls for completion of the building of the Planeta two-tiered weather-observation system, which is being developed on the basis of the Meteor-3 space vehicle and the Electro geostationary weather satellite. The work to improve them will continue. Existing and future series-produced and experimental satellites such as Meteor, Elektro, Prognoz, and Oko, which will carry equipment for direct and remote measurements of various parameters of the near-Earth environment, are expected to be used to regulate the monitoring of heliogeophysical parameters and the state of near-Earth space. Some of the measurements will be made with equipment launched into space in the context of conversion programs. Information will be collected, processed, and disseminated by the geophysical services of Roskomgidromet. The successful implementation of the outlined program will improve the efficiency of the use of the Northern Sea Route, reduce spending on the geological study of territories and the inventory of agricultural and farm areas, and make it possible to predict harvests in any region of Russia and the bioproductivity of commercial regions of the ocean and monitor dangerous anthropogenic effects on the living environment. Space-Based Navigation and Geodesy Space vehicles that are continuously in the same orbits can provide tens of thousands of ground-based consumers with navigational and geodesic information. Now more than 4,500 ships are equipped with satellite navigation gear that enables them to ascertain their position within 100 m or less. That reduces transportation expenses and increases the safety of travel. From space, highly accurate measurements are made of certain movements of the Earth's crust that have extraordinary significance in the prediction of earthquakes. The international Cospas-Sarsat system ascertains the position of ships, aircraft, and expeditions that are in distress. It has already helped rescue more than 2,500 people. In the near future, satellite navigation systems will service mobile civilian users with a high degree of precision and promptness. Up to the year 2000, plans call for the use of the dual-purpose space-based navigational-geodesic Glonass complex, which is already deployed in orbit, to provide navigational support of national- economy users and to perform geodesic measurements. When the number of satellites of that system reaches the planned level (36), the system will provide a continuous global \"navigation field\" of the required accuracy (no less than 100 m for navigation and 15-20 m for geodesy). At the same time, also in use will be the military navigation system Tsikada, which is based on the low-orbit Nadezhda vehicles, which are being upgraded and, in addition to serving the needs of navigation and relaying distress signals (Cospas system), will be used for collecting and relaying auxiliary dispatcher information of the Ministry of the Navy of the Russian Federation (the Kurs system). Control of transportation systems of a higher class (river vessels, railways, and auto transport) will be done both by a system of personal communications (Gonets, Koskon, and Ariadna satellites) and through the use of high-orbit mobile-communications satellites (the Marafon system) in combination with a ground-based infrastructure that includes a network of reference navigation- communication stations. Work will continue until the end of the current decade to achieve metric and submetric accuracies in space-based navigational and geodesic systems. That, in turn, will make it possible to solve a multitude of new national-economy and technical problems. It is entirely possible that the economic impact of that will enable the achievement of cost recovery for coordinate-metric complexes. All that work will be a part of Russia's Standardized Program for Coordinate-Time Support. Military Objectives In the defense area, space hardware will, as before, help to effectively monitor adherence to international agreements, which will make it possible to achieve a standardized information space for all combat arms, and it will occupy a special place in navigation, geodesy, and other areas of support for the armed forces. Worldwide experience shows that, without space-based systems, it is difficult to count on a high level of effectiveness of the modern army. As before, an immense contribution to the support of the space activity of our country will be made by the military-space forces of the Russian Ministry of Defense. They will perform most of the work at the space launch facilities; a number of dual-purpose space systems (i.e., used both for military and for national-economy objectives) will be used as the ground tracking complex. Science-Related Space Research This type of space activity enriches us with discoveries and new fundamental knowledge. In earlier years, we gained important data on near-Earth space, on the Moon and the planets, and on the processes that occur in the atmosphere of the Earth and the Sun. Much has changed in our notions of the world around us and about the origin and evolution of the universe. It would be hard to overemphasize the significance that astrophysical and radiophysical research from space holds for the solution of many fundamental problems of modern science. Instead of just the two small \"windows\" in the optical and radio ranges accessible to ground-based observation, science now has an opportunity to conduct research across the entire spectrum. The current program for the creation of new science-related space hardware is aimed at obtaining fundamental results in astrophysics, planetology, geophysics, and the study of the Sun and solar- terrestrial relationships. The last area has been given priority, because the results obtained will make it possible to effectively solve a number of applied problems involving the physics of the ionosphere and the biosphere of the Earth. Such projects will include Interbol, Solnechnyy zond [Solar Probe], and Regata [Regatta]. They will be performed with spacecraft of the AUOS family of satellites (developed by NPO Yuzhnoye, in Ukraine), and some unusually interesting science programs have been outlined for them. The Solar Probe, for example, which will execute a flyby of the Sun at the closest possible distance from the standpoint of ballistics, will provide us with unique information about the Sun and the near-Sun environment and will perform gravitational experiments. Astrophysical research is to be done from aboard the Prognoz-M2 vehicle (in the Relikt-2 project) and the Spektr and Nika-3 vehicles (in experiments involving a study of cosmic rays). The program for the further study of the planets includes the creation in 1994-1996 of the Mars-94/96 and Mars-Aster space vehicles for studying the Red Planet and asteroids from Martian-satellite orbit and with landers. The next stage is expected to deliver Martian soil samples back to Earth. A program of biomedical research will be performed with the Bion and Nika-B space vehicles, as well as from aboard manned complexes. Much work will be done on the basis of international cooperation. Manned Flights and Launch Hardware It is important to note that the Program stipulates the creation of ecologically clean launch systems. In the period up to the year 2000, the Proton and Soyuz launch vehicles will be upgraded. A competition is expected to be conducted very soon for the creation of the mid-class Angara launcher, a standardized series of Dvina upper stages, and small Neva launchers. Work will get under way for the creation of a more advanced heavy launch-vehicle, the Energiya-M, and the development of reusable rocket and aerospace transportation systems (including commercial systems). Particular attention will be devoted to the efficient use of the Russian launch facilities Plesetsk and Kapustin Yar. As before, work will be done that involves servicing and expanding the capabilities of the Baykonur launch facility (in Kazakhstan). A special place in science-related and applied space research is held by manned missions. Although unmanned vehicles will, as before, be regarded as the main means of studying and using space, the Program calls for maintaining Russia's leadership in long-duration manned missions. Our orbital stations have been operating successfully in near-Earth orbit for many years. They have been a base for the study of natural resources and mapping of the Earth; study of the atmosphere; and study of physical phenomena and processes that occur in space, astronomical observations, and biomedical research. New onboard systems and instruments have been worked out, experiments have been performed, and industrial operations have been conducted involving space technology and materials science. Essentially, the stations have been integrated science laboratories in which man's participation has expanded considerably the capabilities for conducting research. In 1993-1995, the Program is to continue the operation of the Mir station, dock two modules to it, and raise its performance specifications to the level planned in its development. That will make it possible to use the station's service life in full, thereby getting maximum return. In 1996-2000, the operation of the Mir-2 station, with a crew of up to nine people, may get under way; the Mir-2 is being developed right now by NPO Energiya on the basis of the design experience garnered in the construction and operation of the base unit of the Mir station. Mir-2 will be lofted into an orbit with an inclination of 65 (Mir has an inclination of 51.6), which will expand considerably the possibilities for solving resources-management and ecological problems. Mir-2 will be made up of fundamentally new modules, including a biological module, an engineering module, and an environmental module. The Soyuz-TM transport and the Progress-M cargo resupply craft will be used for the time being in the first stage to provide transportation- and maintenance-related service. International Space Activity Ever increasing significance in the field of space activity is attaching to the integration of the efforts of many countries. Such integration enables the most efficient and economically beneficial performance of the most complex, expensive, large-scale space programs. At present, Russia is successfully collaborating with 18 countries in space activity, developing and implementing a variety of projects for various purposes. For example, in the context of an agreement between Russia and the United States, the flight of a Russian cosmonaut aboard the Shuttle is slated for October of this year; and in 1994, an American astronaut will fly aboard the Mir orbital complex. Between now and the year 2000, an additional four French citizens will visit the Mir stations, as will astronauts from the European Space Agency. Still in the study stage is the project involving the use of the Soyuz spacecraft as a rescue craft for the International Space Station Freedom. The Program calls for forms of external space activity such as the launch of foreign satellites, the leasing of space hardware, the tracking support of foreign satellites, the exchange of space-derived data, and the provision to foreign parties of the opportunity to receive those data from our space vehicles. Promising space hardware will be developed, manufactured, and perfected in the context of joint projects or individual contracts, and a mutually beneficial exchange of space technologies will be effected. Joint space-based programs are slated in the area of scientific research involving near-Earth space, the Sun, and the planets; in the creation of space-based production of materials, semiconductors, and biopreparations. All that will be of considerable assistance to our space program in this time of limited funding. Of exceptional importance to Russia's space program is the high- priority area of systems-related, basic, and applied scientific research involving the creation of an advanced scientific-technical and engineering stock of available research. For the first time ever, the funding has been increased substantially for scientific research operations in that area, funding that now stands at about 10 percent of the total amount allocated by the budget for the development of the space program. Carrying out Russia's new space policy and implementing the State Space Program will enable our country, which built the road into space, to maintain its status as a leading space power and use the space program to renew Russia and make it flourish.

Computer digital images are generated using raw radar data collected by the U.S. ocean surveillance satellite SEASAT-A. The images cover 2,048 cells in the range direction and two synthetic apertures in the azimuth direction with an imaging area of approximately 38 km x 34 km. The high-quality radar images with a resolution of 25 m x 25 m have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. I. Introduction During the past 20 years, the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as an advanced microwave remote sensor has attracted a great deal of attention. Since the mid-1970s, SAR technology has evolved from airborne applications to spaceborne applications. In recent years, significant progress has been made in spaceborne SAR technology. Since the launch of the SEASAT-A satellite by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1978, the U.S. SIR-A, SIR-B, SIR-C, and European ERS-1, the Canadian RADAR SAT and the Japanese JERS-1 satellites have all been equipped with advanced SAR imaging systems. The unique features of spaceborne SAR systems are: high altitude, extended range and coverage, wide bandwidth, and high data rate; also, various error correction and compensation schemes and complex signal processing techniques are used in spaceborne SAR. There are distinct differences between spaceborne SAR and airborne SAR. Because of the relatively low altitude and slow velocity of airborne SAR, the Earth can be regarded as a large planar surface, which makes signal processing relatively easy. In the case of spaceborne SAR, however, the effects of Earth rotation and Earth curvature produce coupling in the radar returns between the range direction and the azimuth direction; as a result, azimuth compression of the radar signal becomes very complicated. In general, digital image processing for spaceborne SAR involves range processing, azimuth processing, motion compensation and multi-look processing, of which the most difficult problems are azimuth processing and motion compensation. In this paper, a method of digital imaging using spaceborne SAR is presented. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the high-resolution images generated using raw radar data collected by the U.S. SEASAT-A satellite. II. Mathematical Model of the Radar Signal The radar transmits a linear frequency-modulated (FM) pulse signal. Let _D_ be the pulse width, T be the pulse repetition period, R(t) be the slant range between the satellite and the ground target, W[.sup]a[/](t) be the azimuth directivity function of the antenna, _s_(x,r) be the scattering coefficient of the ground target, a(t) be a step function of width _D_, _l_ be the wavelength, and c be the speed of light; then the radar return signal can be expressed as:[.sup]1[/] s(x,r) = _s_(x,r)W[.sup]r[/](r) * h[.sub]1[/](x,r) *[.sup]r[/]h[.sub]2[/](x,r) (1) where W[.sup]r[/](r) is the range directivity function of the antenna, * is the two-dimensional convolution with respect to azimuth x and range r; *[.sup]r[/] is the one-dimensional convolution with respect to range r. Also, In the above equation, f[.sup]D[/] is the Doppler center frequency, f[.sup]R[/] is the rate of change of Doppler frequency, v is the satellite velocity relative to the ground, and b is the frequency-modulation rate. One can see from the radar signal model that the radar return is a complicated two-dimensional convolution; the purpose of signal processing is to extract the scattering characteristics of the target from the received signal, and ultimately to form a high-quality radar image. III. Range-Compression Processing Range processing of spaceborne SAR actually implies pulse compression. Digital pulse compression in the range direction uses FFT for matched filter implementation. The processed signal can be expressed as: where c[.sup]0[/] = 2b_D_/c. It is known from the principle of pulse compression that the slant range resolution after pulse compression is: _r_[.sup]r[/] = c/2B[.sub]r[/] and the ground range resolution is: where B[.sup]r[/] is the signal bandwidth, H is the satellite altitude, R[.sup]e[/] is the mean Earth radius, and _th_ is the antenna viewing angle. The number of samples of the range reference function is where f[.sup]s[/] is the sampling frequency. The raw data collected by SEASAT-A are digital data produced by the A/D converter; prior to range processing, they must first be orthogonalized and then matched-filtered. The orthogonalization process is accomplished in the frequency domain, where a window function is applied and the signal carrier frequency is shifted to zero frequency; finally, a complex IFFT [inverse fast Fourier transform] is performed to complete the process of range digital pulse compression. This process is equivalent to a transformation from real data to complex data; the complex data are stored for azimuth processing. IV. Azimuth-Compression Processing The azimuth reference function is chosen based on the expression of the range-compressed radar signal:[.sup]2[/] Due to the effect of range drift, coupling between the range direction and the azimuth direction exists in the radar return; therefore, azimuth processing requires complicated two-dimensional processing. In fact, azimuth processing is actually a two-dimensional matched filtering; the filtered output signal represents the scattering characteristics of the ground target, which is of the form: _s_[.sup]0[/](x,r) = s[.sub]R[/](x,r) * h[.sup]*[/][.sup]a[/](x,r) (8) The implementation of two-dimensional matched filtering for azimuth processing is highly computation-intensive. By using a hybrid time-domain and frequency-domain correlation technique, the two-dimensional problem reduces to a one-dimensional problem, and the correction of range drift can be accomplished in the frequency domain; as a result, the amount of computation is greatly reduced. For a second-order curve R(x), the azimuth reference function for range r[.sup]0[/] is: where d[.sup]i[/] is the distance of the range reference value r[.sup]0[/], and The expression in the frequency domain after azimuth processing is of the form: It can be seen from the above expression that the hybrid correlation method uses time-domain correlation in the range direction and frequency-domain correlation in the azimuth direction; this approach takes full advantage of the FFT and therefore provides an efficient way of calculating precision impulse response. If the above method is applied directly for azimuth compression, the amount of computation will increase with increasing Doppler center frequency. A more efficient way would be to apply correction to the range wander (the linear term of range drift) before azimuth pulse compression, then apply correction to the range bending (the second-order term of range drift) in the frequency domain; this approach requires less computation, and R(x) in the azimuth reference function g[.sup]i[/](x,r[.sub]0[/]) becomes: Computer results show that the digital images of spaceborne SAR produced by this method and the previous method are almost identical, but the amount of computation for azimuth compression (at f[.sup]D[/] = 980 Hz) is reduced by one half. V. Motion Compensation Because of antenna pointing error and errors caused by satellite motion, it is difficult to accurately estimate the Doppler center frequency and the rate of change of Doppler frequency from satellite historical data and from SAR parameters. Inaccuracy in the Doppler center frequency and in the rate of change of Doppler frequency will have an adverse effect on SAR images. Inaccuracy in the Doppler center frequency will result in lower signal-to-noise ratio, which in turn will cause an increase in the fuzziness in azimuth and a shift in the target position. Inaccuracy in the rate of change of Doppler frequency will cause defocusing in the radar images and result in a decrease in pixel resolution. An effective method of estimating the Doppler parameters is to estimate the errors in the Doppler parameters directly from the radar return data. The clutter lock used for estimating the errors in the Doppler center frequency is obtained from the normalized energy difference of the symmetric multi-look sub-images.[.sup]3[/] Experimental results show that the error in the Doppler center frequency is proportional to the normalized energy difference _D_E: _D_f[.sup]D[/] f[.sub]R[/]T_D_E (13) where T is the time required for the satellite to travel the distance of one aperture. The auto-focusing used for estimating the rate of change of Doppler frequency is determined by the relationships between the multi-look sub-images. The offset between the first-look sub-image and the Nth-look sub-image _D_X can be obtained from the relationship between the two sub-images. Experimental results show that the offset is proportional to the errors in the rate of change of Doppler frequency: _D_f[.sup]R[/] f[.sub]R[/] _D_X/vT (14) Accurate estimates of the Doppler center frequency and the rate of change of Doppler frequency can be obtained by an iterative procedure. For example, for an image around the city of London, the estimation error of the Doppler center frequency is less than 10 Hz, and the estimation error of the rate of change of Doppler frequency is less than 0.3 Hz/sec. VI. Spaceborne SAR Digital Imaging Raw radar data of an area around the city of London have been collected by the U.S. SEASAT-A satellite; the center of the area is located at 51.43 N. latitude and 0.33 E. longitude. The radar parameters and signal processing parameters are as follows:  The estimated Doppler center frequency and the rate of change of Doppler frequency are approximately 940 Hz and 505 Hz/s, and the range drift is 43 range resolution cells. In order to reduce the effect of spot noise during the formation of the radar signal, we use an iterative procedure of non-coherent integration of 4-look sub-images. Figure 1 [photo not reproduced] shows the computer-generated digital image obtained using the method given in this paper. The processed image has a resolution of 25 m x 25 m; the imaging area covers 2,048 range cells and two synthetic apertures in the azimuth direction, which corresponds to an area of approximately 38 km x 34 km. During the imaging process, Doppler parameters are estimated every 128 range cells. VII. Conclusion By applying the spaceborne SAR digital imaging method presented in this paper, we have generated computer images using raw radar data collected by the U.S. SEASAT-A satellite. These are the first high-resolution spaceborne SAR images obtained in this country; the image resolution is 25 m x 25 m. The results of computer images have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method. References 1.

            "text": "Language: French Article Type:CSO [Article: \"Nonlinear Institute of Nice (INLN) Launched at Sophia-Antipolis\"] [Text] Sophia-Antipolis--The Nonlinear Institute of Nice (INLN), a joint research unit of CNRS [National Scientific Research Center] and the University of Nice, officially inaugurated its new Sophia-Antipolis facility on 22 November. Created in January 1991, the institute headed by Gerard Iooss, a professor at the University of Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, was housed until now at the University of Nice. In attendance for the inauguration were CNRS director general Francois Kourilsky, Nice University president Michel Bornancin, Mr. Pierre Laffitte, a senator and president of \"High Technology Road\" (an association of provincial technology centers), and a number of mathematicians, physicists, and chemists including Ilya Prigogine (Nobel Prize for chemistry, 1977). The ceremony afforded Mr. Daniel Thoulouze, head of CNRS's Department of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, the opportunity to present the Center's 1993 Silver Medal to Pierre Coullet, head of the INLN research group studying \"instability and chaos\". The staff of INLN, whose founders include Gerard Iooss and Pierre Coullet, consists now of 31 scientists and academics in diverse disciplines--mathematics, theoretical physics, experimental physics, engineering, etc.--26 graduate students, and 12 \"visitors.\" It seems destined for further growth: Although Nice-based nonlinear phenomena researchers have succeeded in creating a real school, a number of similar laboratories have long been in existence in the United States. According to one expert in this domain, Albert Libchaber (Princeton University and NEC laboratory), \"Europe is far behind the United States in this field.\" INLN is divided into six groups--\"instability and chaos,\" \"theory of branch-points and applications,\" \"theory of (quantal) fields and applications,\" \"topological and differentiable dynamics,\" \"stability and boundary control of continuous media,\" and \"experimental nonlinear dynamics\"--composed of mathematicians and physicists as well as researchers in optics, meteorology, and biology. Currently staying as a guest at the institute is Russian scientist Professor Valentine Krinsky, whose work focuses particularly on chaotic phenomena in cardiology and who might remain at INLN. With this new installation, CNRS strengthens its infrastructural base in Sophia-Antipolis, now the site of three of its own laboratories, two joint laboratories, and seven affiliated laboratories, in addition to the Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur [PACA] regional delegation's branch office for Alpes-Maritimes. Nonlinear Meteorology In meteorology, a field marked by chaotic phenomena, research into nonlinear phenomena can help improve forecasting. For decades now, according to Guy Plaut, INLN's only meteorologist, autumns in Provence have been either unusually dry or punctuated by repeated \"deluges.\" This year, between 13 September and 10 October, downpours were truly torrential: 90mm of water on 13 September, 50 on 23 September, 40 on 1 October. Once a \"cycle\" of drought or very high rainfall is established, it tends to last a long time. There is no way yet to make predictions in this kind of situation, but by correlating precipitation readings with measurements of barometric pressure (at sea level and high in the atmosphere) in the North Atlantic, it should be possible to identify the critical determinants for these rains and make probabilistic forecasts. Doing so will require data--40 years' worth--at both global (hemispheric) and local levels--from the National Meteorological Center of Boulder (Colorado) as well as Nice's Meteo-France weather station, for example. In future, says Plaut, it should be possible to predict by late August the likelihood of these autumn \"deluges.\" In general, it should be possible to make probabilistic predictions for any such changes of broad weather pattern. The study of nonlinear phenomena can also help predict consequences of the greenhouse effect. \"We must not think about the greenhouse effect in linear terms,\" says Plaut: It could push climatological variables into a \"sensitive\" or chaotic zone that might lead either to warming or to cooling. \"Paradoxically, a warming trend could in theory lead to a cooling effect.\""

            "text": "Language: French Article Type:CSO [Text] Strasbourg/Paris--The daily newspaper LES DERNIERES NOUVELLES D'ALSACE reported 15 January that French researchers from the European School for Advanced Chemical Industry Research (EHICS) had just devised new molecules that can trap cesium with great efficiency. The Atomic Energy Commission's Nuclear Research Center in Cadarache and COGEMA (General Nuclear Materials Company) collaborated with EHICS on the molecules, which are dubbed calixarenes. \"In the future, calixarenes may be able to reduce the volume and weight of radioactive waste by a factor of 100. Highly radioactive waste, which is buried 500 meters underground, could be concentrated, while waste of lower radioactive levels could be stored 20 meters below the surface,\" said one of the research team \"bosses\", Jacques Vincens of EHICS. Calixarenes are one of the first industrial applications of supramolecular chemistry, whose father, Professor Jean-Marie Lehn, won the 1987 Nobel prize for chemistry. The Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) describes the cup-shaped molecules as a \"step forward\" in research to manage highly-active, long-lived radioactive waste. But it will be at least another 10 years before the molecules can be applied industrially. Jean-Yves Barre, director of the CEA's \"fuel cycle\" division, explained to the AFP that calixarene, a \"highly selective chemical gripper\", is \"a cage-molecule that will be able to capture the desired element in a solution, extract it from the solution, and release it on demand.\" Another advantage of using the \"very selective\" molecule to extract radioactive elements is that it is not very water-soluble and does not deplete. In other words, \"Calixarenes are not destroyed through use.\" For now, calixarene molecules can only trap cesium and its various isotopes extracted together. Cesium isotopes include long-lived (2.3 million years) cesium-135, which researchers want to recover, and cesium-137, which has an average lifespan (30 years). Barre says that the team headed by Jean-Francois Dozo in Cadarache \"has gotten yields of 99 percent.\" The discovery is part of ongoing research programs--some of them European1--to find ways of reducing the noxiousness of long-lived, nuclear-plant radioactive waste through chemical separation or transmutation. The teams have been working on the calixarenes for seven or eight months, and recently filed a patent on the process. In France, the investigations are an application of the 30 December 1991 law on \"research into the management of radioactive waste.\" The law also deals with \"the study of possible ways to reversibly or irreversibly store waste in deep underground geological formations, notably in underground laboratories\", and \"research on ways to package and warehouse such waste for long periods on the surface.\" The CEA has assigned 190 million French francs [Fr] and 250 people to the separation/transmutation project, otherwise known as SPIN, or Separation and Incineration of Long-Lived Radioactive Elements. (The entire waste-management research program involves Fr440 million and a staff of 500.) SPIN itself consists of two subprograms: PURETEX, which aims to reduce waste and improve the performance of COGEMA's retreatment plants in La Hague (through enhanced separation of plutonium and neptunium, among other methods); and ACTINEX, which seeks to improve PURETEX and destroy long-lived products. ACTINEX employs additional separations of plutonium, neptunium, americium, and curium from long-lived fission products, using accelerators to transmute the long-lived radioactive elements contained in such waste.

            "text": "Language: Russian Article Type:BFN [Article by Igor Tsarev and Oleg Zolotov: \"The `Chemical Bomb' Is About To Explode: It Is Easier To Cope With Obstinate Scientists, Evidently, Than With Lethal Weapons\"] [Text] Last week was marked by a new scandal around the \"Mirzayanov affair.\" We would remind our readers that this story has already been going on for more than two years. And it started with the fact that two doctors of chemical science--Lev Fedorov and Vil Mirzayanov, sincerely believing, apparently, in democratic changes (the affair took place soon after the failure of the August putsch), placed an article in one of the Moscow newspapers about the fact that our military is continuing to create and test binary chemical weapons. In a year a similar article by the same authors appeared in another newspaper. At this point the scientists were accused of divulging a state secret. Vil Mirzayanov was thrown into Lefortovo prison. An investigation began. However, under the pressure of public opinion the Ministry of Security nevertheless released the professor after 10 days... Time passed. The instituted \"Mirzayanov case\" vanished. There was a change in the leadership of the Procuracy General, which filed an indictment at that time. Russia signed (one more time) a general agreement on chemical disarmament. A new Constitution was adopted. But the \"Mirzayanov case,\" as before, is as alive as ever. The events of last weak confirmed this. V. MIRZAYANOV: \"A closed session of the Moscow city court, which occurred in the best traditions of the past, was held on 24 January. My lawyer declared that the case lacks a special purpose program of scientific research in the sphere of chemical weapons, the results of which I would allegedly divulge, and that on the grounds of Paragraph 3 of Article 15 of the Basic Law a citizen cannot be subjected to criminal proceedings on the basis of normative acts not published in the open press... We requested the assignment of a new examination by experts in which independent experts could participate, inasmuch as previously it was conducted by specialists of the KGB who represented the interests of the military-industrial complex. But the court declined this petition. Then I said that I do not have a feeling of trust in `the justice being administered,' and I refused to answer any further questions.\" The action developed in the following way. On 25 January two militiamen appeared at the apartment of the scientist and ordered him to accompany them, explaining this demand by the need to deliver Mirzayanov to a court session scheduled for 1030 the following day. \"So, come and get me in the morning,\" the professor said. The scientist was still free Thursday morning. When we called him at home, his wife--Nuriya Mirzayanova--picked up the phone. She said that she was a little sick and that Vil Sultanovich had just gone to the pharmacy for medicine... But within an hour we were informed that he had been arrested and sent to Sailors' Rest. It is difficult to say at this point how this story will end. But it is already obvious that there are forces that prefer to contend with the scientists, who are telling the truth, but not with the chemical weapons. It should be recalled here that the first treaty in which chemical weapons were acknowledged to be illegal was signed as far back as the last century--in 1868. And it must be noted that first conference in human history to condemn barbaric chemical weapons was conducted specifically at the initiative of Russia. If the military seriously wanted to get rid of toxic chemical agents, chemical weapons would have disappeared from the face of the earth a long time ago. But, as before, they continue to exist, continue to be perfected, and are becoming more and more dangerous for humanity. FROM THE CHRONICLE OF CHEMICAL WARS: --1915. The Kaiser's Army employed poison gas against the French. Within five minutes 180 tonnes of chlorine gas were released from 6,000 cylinders. As a result, 15,000 French soldiers and officers died in terrible torment. --1949. The Israeli Army employed toxic chemical agents against the Egyptians. --1950. The United States used sarin during the war in Korea. --1983. The Pentagon preceded the invasion of the island of Granada with a chemical attack. American specialists even photographed the excruciating death of 2,000 islanders and transported their bodies to the United States \"for further research.\" It can be assumed that the new binary weapon was being tested at that time. In contrast to other countries that are not ashamed of their achievements in the sphere of development of this barbarous weapon, our state tried to conduct itself more decently, emphasizing this in every way to world public opinion. At least the statement of Soviet scientists in May 1982 should be mentioned: \"Adhering strictly to the 1925 Geneva protocol, the USSR has never employed chemical weapons anywhere.\" What was said generally corresponded to the truth, but it does not draw the entire picture. The Soviet policy of \"chemical disarmament\" had a hidden bottom... --1987. M. Gorbachev declared at the UN that the USSR had completely stopped the production of toxic chemical agents. At that same time, final work was being conducted in Moscow, at the State Union NII [Scientific Research Institute] of Organic Chemistry and Technology (GSNIIOKhT), on a new chemical agent that surpassed the celebrated VX gas in its sinister characteristics. --1991. M. Gorbachev, who became a Nobel laureate due to his peacekeeping activity, confers the Lenin Prize in the Kremlin on the creator of the Soviet \"binary\" weapon. Among the fathers of this terrible weapon were V. Petrunin, director of GSNIIOKhT, and General A. Kuntsevich, deputy chief of the Chemical Troops. --1992. The president of the Russian Federation declares that Russia supports the agreement with the United States on the nonproduction and destruction of chemical weapons. But the committee working on problems of chemical weapons destruction that was established at that time was headed by... the father of the country's \"binary\" weapon, A. Kuntsevich. It is not very surprising that this same \"binary\" weapon was soon undergoing tests at the secret proving ground Ustyurt (near the city of Nukus). Against the background of contradictory facts (plus the story about Professor Mirzayanov), talk about \"total chemical disarmament\" has to be taken with a large dose of skepticism. It will be recalled that not one previous international convention destroyed chemical weapons. On the contrary, they became even more lethal, increasing destructive power thousands of times. But as for the planned destruction of toxic chemical agents... From time to time in any army, tanks, aircraft, rockets... are written off and destroyed. For example, the dismantling and salvaging of general purpose munitions (mines, projectiles, bombs, torpedoes, etc.) is taking place in Russia as soon as their useful life expires. According to some data there are 1.2 million tonnes of such combat charges at bases and in arsenals of the Ministry of Defense. This colossal amount of old junk has to be destroyed. But this occurs without any kind of hullabaloo--it is an operational process, nothing more. Chemical weapons should also be subjected to the same kind of destruction. Thus, why make a \"worldwide show\" of this? Perhaps behind the \"smoke screen\" of appeals and promises to avoid the fact that the weapons were to have been destroyed anyway, and it would be easier to conceal the true intentions? To get rid of the old junk and arm oneself with new toxic chemical agents that were not taken into account in convention documents, and so it is as if they were not even banned? V. MIRZAYANOV: \"Our military generals have been ready for a chemical war under conditions of an international ban for a long time. They have conducted training at bases and in institutes and plants in the event of a surprise visit by international monitors. They have prepared the organization of the kind of industry in which material was always in operation that could be easily transformed into highly toxic chemical agents. You will agree: If we are developing, producing, and testing new types of chemical agents, but we are not including them in the list subject to international monitoring, then this is by no means being done from good motives. Rather, this is an attempt to get around the convention, which unquestionably contradicts the interests of both Russia and its citizens. After all, it is assumed at the same time that the other participants in the convention will behave in a similar way.\" Thousands of people, including people of very high rank in military uniform, have been put to work on the creation, testing, and production of chemical weapons. Is it easy to renounce that which has fed you all your life? Our country, which has accumulated thousands and thousands of tonnes of toxic chemical agents, did not employ them even during the Great Patriotic War. But these tonnes have already killed more than one life (not enemies--but our own people), they have undermined the health of many workers engaged in the production of poisons, they have contaminated the area around the plants, and they have permanently destroyed the ecology. But is it not simpler generally to abandon chemical weapons, even those that are super-modern and not yet taken into account in the last convention? V. Mirzayanov was arrested. The trial continues. The decision will become a litmus paper that will reveal once and for all how serious the intentions of the Russian military are in renouncing chemical weapons. Incidentally, the possibility of arrest now hangs over still another chemist--V. Uglev. He is also accused of divulging a \"state secret.\" Uglev himself says: \"There was nothing secret in the article by Mirzayanov and Fedorov, neither chemical formulae nor any kind of specific substances that were part of the weapon were indicated. However, if the authorities do not take these facts into account, then after the next session of the court (scheduled for 3 February), I will be forced to name some formulae...\""

The president justified the presence of 200 American soldiers who represent 10 percent of the total contingent that will be arriving in the Central American nation this year to participate in social welfare projects. De Leon regretted the involvement of Rigoberta Menchu, a Guatemalan Indian and 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who sent a letter to President William Clinton urging him to reconsider the \"current U.S. military policy toward Guatemala.\" At a meeting with the press the president explained that joint projects are being carried out with the U.S. Government to improve the standard of living of residents in Salama, Baja Verapaz, which is located 150 km north of Guatemala City. Nevertheless, Menchu pointed out that the presence of U.S. troops in Guatemala \"is unacceptable,\" especially when one considers that the United States is a member of the Group of Friendly Countries and \"must demonstrate neutrality at all times.\" Furthermore, it \"complicates our reality and considerably hinders the process of demilitarizing Guatemala and its society.\" The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala has announced that from 6 January through the beginning of June 1994, 10 groups of 200 men each will be sent to Guatemala for training. For the Fuertes Caminos program the troops will use 150 vehicles including tractors, semi-trailers, trucks, bulldozers, perforation equipment, and jeeps for personnel transportation, as well as two helicopters for emergency medical evacuations. De Leon Carpio expressed surprise over Menchu's position, saying that \"she lacks the information\" to oppose the Fuertes Caminos project, the purpose of which is to increase the well-being of the inhabitants of Salama, Baja Verapaz."

He announced that, according to UNHCR figures, there are a total of 20 million forced migrants and 19 million refugees in the world who have left their countries for various reasons. Their fate is complex, they endure terrible trials and risk their lives, but as long as persecution and discrimination persist a refugee problem will be inevitable. This has been confirmed by life -- the UNHCR was set up in 1951 for just three years, but still exists today. It has already solved problems for 13 million refugees and has twice been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize -- in 1954 and 1981. Speaking about the situation in Russia, the UN representative noted that the refugee problem is still a new one for this country. Until recently the former Soviet Union was aware of just one \"sort\" of refugees -- Communists who had fled from their own countries and were accepted by the USSR for exclusively political reasons. This happened following the Spanish Civil War and the Chilean coup. It was only after perestroyka and the collapse of the Union that the top Russian authorities joined the world community, which deals with refugee issues in humanitarian terms, in terms of the protection of their rights. Juan Amunategi drew attention to the fact that, despite recognizing international documents and despite its own laws on refugees and forced migrants, Russia is often incapable of meeting its own commitments, because its economic position is failing to improve. In this connection, the UN representative noted, the Commission considered it necessary to give Russia all the assistance it could in solving this complex problem. This assistance will be implemented in six areas. Juan Amunategi said that priority should go to the defense of refugees' rights and to aid to the country's government in creating institutions and organs capable of skillfully tackling the problem. Amunategi also noted that the law on refugees envisages the creation of transit camps for them. Four such camps already exist near Moscow, currently housing around 1,000 refugees. It is planned to give them material aid. One other important area is to curb emigration -- in particular, by informing citizens planning to leave their own countries and come to Russia of the real living conditions facing refugees. Conditions should be created for arriving refugees to integrate into the local community -- this will benefit not only the refugees but the locals."

Allan Hendrickse has complained to the ANC [African National Congress] leadership that he has been \"villified\" and \"kept in the dark\" about nominations and that there is a general \"hostility\" towards his party from certain ANC elements. In a letter to the ANC leadership on December 21, he appealed for a \"bilateral\" on January 12 to iron out differences. The letter, addressed to the \"Chairman of the ANC list committee\" with copies to ANC leader Mr. Nelson Mandela and ANC secretary-general Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, is the first official acknowledgement by Mr. Hendrickse that he felt he and his party were \"unwelcome\" in ANC ranks. This is despite the fact that Mr. Mandela included him in his entourage to Oslo to accept the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with State President F.W. De Klerk on December 10. There is great division within the ANC on whether the LP, the main coloured party to make possible the Tricameral Parliament -- which in turn drew fierce opposition from the Anti-Tricameral Parliament Movement, the United Democratic Front -- should now be taken on board the ANC election ticket. Whereas Mr. Mandela likes the idea of having Mr. Hendrickse as a \"magnet\" to attract coloured voters, elements within the ANC in the western Cape -- including western Cape chairman Dr. Allan Boesak -- are against it, despite the fact the LP is a partner in the Patriotic Front which acted as a united group during the Kempton Park negotiations. Because of the bad blood between the LP and ANC rank and file members, it came as no surprise to observers when Mr. Ramaphosa, punted by the LP as the keynote speaker at its 28th annual congress in Cape Town this week, never turned up. Nor was there a single observer from the western Cape region of the ANC. The ANC \"snub\" occurred despite Mr. Hendrickse devoting his entire opening speech on Tuesday to urging coloured people to vote for the ANC on April 27. The antagonism between the LP and the ANC is clearly acknowledged by Mr. Hendrickse in his letter to the leadership -- of which the SUNDAY TIMES has a copy -- which reads: \"The LP of SA [South Africa] was kept in the dark about details of the intended nomination procedure until it was too late to prepare for regional nomination conferences. LP members from different parts of the country eked out varying degrees of information and each followed his own procedure. The head committee of the LP of SA had no control over the nomination of persons from its ranks. The LP was granted such minuscule representation at the regional conferences and ... the hostility towards LP members is still too great for Labour to stand a fair chance. In the western Cape (ANC) conference, voting was preceded by meetings where questions and statements from the floor were provided for. This allowed people to vent their spleen. The Labour Party was villified and condemned as opportunists ...\""

An AFP reporter in Rangoon confirmed the armed guards and wooden guard boxes on either side of the entrance to her home had been removed. But security remained tight outside the house and there was no indication the status of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner -- who has been under house arrest since July 20, 1989 -- had changed. The section of the road leading to her lakeside compound on University Avenue remained barricaded to traffic at night and security inside the house was believed to still be tight as well. The military government did not announce the move and Burmese officials could not be reached for comment. But sources said the junta probably was tired of scores of foreign reporters visiting the house and taking forbidden photographs, and the removal of the uniformed guards and police likely was intended to make the house look more like others in the area.

            "text": "Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Madrid EFE in Spanish at 0227 GMT 4 January, in a Mexico City datelined item, reports that on 3 January the Guatemalan guerrilla movement confirmed in Mexico City that it is preparing to meet with Guatemalan Government officials between 6 and 9 January. The guerrilla announcement also pointed out that it will not discuss the government's peace proposal during the meeting. The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, URNG, recently indicated through a communique that \"the meeting which is intended to establish the foundations for renewing the peace process negotiation which was interrupted last May, cannot be used to discuss the government's peace plan, nor is said peace plan discussion part of the meeting.\" The URNG insists that the meeting's main objective is to search for alternatives leading to a resumption of peace negotiations that will end the 33-year-old civil war. The announcement also specifies that \"the URNG considers the progress accomplished during the Oslo 1990 and Mexico 1991 negotiations as inalienable. The URNG position will be to preserve the content of the negotiation and the agreements improved by the civilian society and the conciliating role played by Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada.\" According to a Guatemala datelined report by Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 0109 GMT on 4 January, the Permanent Commission for Refugees in Mexico reiterated on Monday that during 1994, it will continue with plans to repatriate approximately 20,000 Guatemalan Indians to their country as scheduled. Commission Leader Ricardo Curtz told NOTIMEX that violence initiated by armed groups operating in the southeastern Mexican State of Chiapas, bordering on Guatemala, will not affect the repatriation program. Curtz also denied that the violence would bring negative repercussions to life in the refugee camps which provide shelter to at least 40,000 Indian refugees who fled to Mexico during the 1980's. The commission leader pointed out that the return of 1,000 refugees housed in the Chiapas refugee camp is scheduled for 12 January and that they will be relocated to a camp set up in Huehuetenango. It is expected that 20,000 refugees out of the 40,000 in Mexico will be repatriated during 1994. Guatemalan Indian leader Rosalina Tuyuc warned on Monday that the guerrilla uprising in Mexico \"is the result of lack of solutions to problems confronted by the Indian and peasant communities\" which could extend to other nations throughout the continent. In a Guatemala City datelined report by Paris AFP in Spanish at 2343 GMT of 3 January, the Indian leader pointed out that \"the methods used by the Mexican rebels to redeem their rights could be repeated in other countries of America since legal or political mechanisms seem very inadequate\" to eliminating discrimination against indigenous populations. Tuyuc is the one of the main leaders of the National Commission of Guatemalan Widows, Conavigua. She proceeds to explain that actions by the guerrilla groups controlling several communities of the Mexican state of Chiapas \"cannot be praised or criticized,\" and also pointed out that \"they have their reasons for embarking on an armed struggle.\" The Conavigua leader specifically points out that despite everything that is taking place, \"the Guatemalan refugees should not be associated\" with the conflict. On the other hand, Rigoberta Menchu, a Guatemalan Indian leader and 1992 Nobel Peace Prize laureate currently living in Mexico, expressed her concern about the repercussions the uprising could have on her country's refugees."

            "text": "Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Mexico City, 6 Jan (AFP) -- The Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) has accused the Mexican Army of taking prisoners, torturing them, then executing them with a shot to the head, according to a communique sent to the daily LA JORNADA and published today. The communique, signed by the Mexico City Urban Front of the EZLN, stated that \"we are struggling against the violence of poverty and hunger, against the violence of the electoral farce and unemployment, and against the disease of the poor. We are fighting for socialism.\" The communique added that \"we are considered outlaws because we are doing this,\" but one \"cannot consider it legal when our demands for a better future are massacred with bombs. We also have a right to speak, but unfortunately the government only understands the language of weapons.\" After making its accusations against the Army, the EZLN urged the Mexican soldiers not to kill innocent people. \"If you have any courage, you must admit that you can no longer tolerate the look of hunger on the faces of our children. If you commit murder, we will be implacable. Refuse to kill honest Mexicans,\" the communique stated. The rebels said they will not carry out any attacks in Mexico City, then asked: \"Have you not yet seen that economic liberalism has failed? Do you not yet understand that other brotherly peoples of the hemisphere will follow us?\" The EZLN also sent a public message to Guatemalan Indian leader Rigoberta Menchu, winner of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, indicating that it is aware of the problems afflicting the Guatemalan refugees in Mexico and that \"perhaps now the Mexican state will no longer be interested in keeping up the facade of protecting refugees in its efforts to implement its repressive policy in the fields of Chiapas and throughout Mexico.\" The communique added: \"Do not be surprised if the government withdraws its support from the refugees, begins to repress them, and accuses them of participating in our struggle. That irresponsible rumor is already circulating among the authorities, who are always ready to seek obscure and disguised enemies where there is only one answer to hunger and oppression.\" The Mexican Government had circulated the rumor that there were Central Americans among the rebels. On Wednesday the National Defense Secretariat announced that one Guatemalan had been arrested, and Deputy Government Secretary Socorro Diaz read a communique stating that the guerrillas are directed by \"foreign and national\" experts. The EZLN reiterated that it bases its uprising on the Constitution and advised Rigoberta Menchu \"to consider our struggle as nothing but a desire to rid ourselves of 500 years of poverty and oppression.\""

            "text": "Language: German Article Type:CSO [Article by \"nl\" under the rubric \"Research and Technology\": \"Karlsruhe Tritium Laboratory/Laboratory Studying the Fuel for an Energy Source for the Distant Future/Settling of Safety Problems. Fusion Research Has Supplanted the Fast Breeder\"; first paragraph is an introduction] [Text] Duesseldorf, Wednesday, 1 Dec 93 (HANDELSBLATT)--Now a tritium laboratory (TLK) has officially opened at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center. This is an experimentation facility by means of which nuclear researchers want to acquire precise information and working know-how in dealing with larger quantities of tritium--a necessary step toward the hoped-for commercial exploitation of nuclear fusion for the generation of electricity in the still distant future. The acquisition of reliability and safety data have to have high priority here. Tritium, the heaviest of the three isotopes of hydrogen, along with deuterium (heavy hydrogen) is needed as fuel for plasma fusion reactors. Nuclear fusion--the fusion of light atomic nuclei and the atomic-energy-liberation process of the sun--is at some time to be utilized in fusion reactors on the earth for energy transformation and the generation of electricity. Therefore, TLK's specified tasks are dictated by the requirements of research and development work on fusion research. The nuclear research center is included with the fusion project in the European fusion technology program and in the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) reactor project. With TLK the nuclear researchers in Karlsruhe have the first finished experimentation facility of this size for fusion research in Europe. As yet they have seen comparable facilities only in Los Alamos, USA and Tokaimura, Japan. The laboratory was built over a period of seven years with an investment of around 45 million German marks [DM]. The state of Baden-Wurttemberg and the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology each absorbed in a special financing arrangement 50 percent of the costs incurred. The Nukem and Siemens companies were appointed as general engineers by the nuclear research center for construction of the laboratory. The laboratory was built in the same building in which a breeder test stand was built in the seventies. This demonstrates the change in KfK's [Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center's] scientific-technical problem range and the reconstruction of its infrastructure and experimentation facilities. Working with the lightest elements, the isotopes of hydrogen, is being practiced today in the same room in which years ago heavy elements like uranium and plutonium were dealt with. Radioactive tritium has a (relatively short) half-life of 12.3 years, but at the same time high diffusibility through other materials. The researchers want to achieve the safe handling of this hydrogen gas by means of a multiple barrier system. This consists of the metal walls of the equipment and pipes in which the gas is handled. In addition, all the apparatus is enclosed by a secondary system with glove boxes, a sub-atmospheric-pressure maintenance system, and tritium hold-up. Development Work for Protection of Personnel and the Environment The building itself constitutes the third barrier. Its exhaust air is constantly monitored. Not only will the feasibility in principle of the occurrence on just the earth of the fusion process that takes place in the sun be decided one day by the realization of this process in a reactor, but also the solution of as yet less discussed safety problems in the protection of personnel and the environment. As a priority, chemical and process engineering problems relating to cleaning the fusion reactor fuel mixture will be worked on within TLK's range of tasks--like, for example, the removal of impurities such as oxygen and nitrogen. Uranium, which combines tritium in the form of uranium tritide (a stable uranium-hydrogen compound) acts as a storage medium. The tritium can be set free again by heating up this storage medium, and the tritium is then available for experiments. An integrated isotope separation system can separate the components of hydrogen mixtures into normal hydrogen (H), deuterium (D) and tritium (T) and resupply the thus purified tritium to the experiments. The pilot plant's process control system is automated and permits round-the-clock operation."

            "text": "Language: Russian Article Type:BFN [Text] It looks as if the world's nuclear power engineers will soon have a safe reactor for power stations. The new reactor design has been put forward by Russian scientists. I interviewed Academician Nikolay Basov, scientific head of research and a Nobel prizewinner. [begin recording] Basov: At present we have nuclear power engineering, and work is under way to create thermonuclear power engineering. There has been great success in this respect with laser thermonuclear fusion, which was proposed by our institute. Today we are on the verge of the so-called break-even, that is, when the energy of laser light will be equal to the energy of a thermonuclear explosion. This is the first stage in the development of thermonuclear energy. In order to obtain energy, we have to have a positive yield of energy, that is the reactor must have an amplification factor greater than one. We estimate it at a hundred or several hundred times more than the laser energy. When that is the case we succeed in closing the cycle and we have a thermonuclear reactor. Why do we need a thermonuclear reactor? Well, oil and gas are running out, but thermonuclear power engineering -- lithium, from which one can obtain tritium and deuterium, is in effect an infinite sea of energy. We believe that there is enough energy here to last tens of thousands of years at least. Announcer: The new reactor is called a hybrid reactor, since its system unites nuclear and thermonuclear subsystems. The times have compelled physicists to use this combination in their work. As a result of disarmament and the decline in research connected with the nuclear energy program large quantities of uranium and plutonium have accumulated, and these can be used successfully in the new reactor. In this system, a laser will act as a source of high intensity neutrons. Basov: In this case, the energy of the laser is approximately 100 times less than the energy needed for a thermonuclear reactor. With the help of neutrons obtained from a thermonuclear explosion, we can try to ignite normal uranium -- not uranium 235 -- natural uranium, or compound uranium. In that case we obtain a very beneficial reactor because it can be kept in a subcritical state, in which thermonuclear explosions of the Chernobyl type are impossible, and that is an extremely attractive prospect. The other attractive thing is that in this instance there is also a significant burnup of uranium. Whereas in normal reactors this is 0.5 percent, here one can expect a burnup of up to 5 percent, that is what we expect from the initial stations, and perhaps in subsequent ones it will reach 50 percent. That is, radioactive chemistry will clearly not be required. That is the principle of this hybrid reactor. There is a great deal of natural compound uranium 238. Today's power engineers already have enough to last for a thousand years, or it can be obtained. In that sense one is getting a very attractive form of power engineering. It is the first step, if you like, of thermonuclear power engineering, and that is what we are doing. Announcer: What stage is the work at now? Basov: A program has been created. It has been approved by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, and it will be examined by top official circles in the near future. It has been approved by the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences and by the institute. It has been approved by the international community. I gave a report at Livermore; I also gave a report in Japan and in a whole range of other countries, and it looks as if we will be cooperating with America, France, Japan, and maybe with other countries. We think that in some time we will manage to hold a conference of the Geneva type to resolve the issue of how to develop this kind of power engineering on an international scale. [end recording]"

Automotive Industry (Italy) A hydrogen-fueled engine developed by the Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and the Environment (ENEA) and VM Motori, in collaboration with Magneti MareIIi and the University of Pisa, is currently being tested on a Fiat van. The engine gives the van a range of about 200 kilometers and is far less polluting than gasoline engines. The hydrogen used to power it is contained in eight pressurized tanks. (Rome AMBIENTE Nov 93) Brussels Bureau/Sharon W. 733-6395 (Italy) The Porter Elettrico, an electric vehicle developed by Piaggio in collaboration with the Micro-Vett company of Imola, was exhibited at the Bologna Motor Show in December. The 4- or 6-seat minibus is a van with a 500-kilogram payload capacity. Another version is a garbage truck with a 400-kilogram payload capacity. All versions are powered by the 10-kilowatt M1O0 electric motor developed by Micro-Vett. Part of the kinetic energy generated in braking is converted to electricity for battery recharge. The vehicle's top speed has been held to 55 kilometers per hour to maximize acceleration and range. The new vehicle is exempt from certain taxes, and its insurance rate has been reduced by 50 percent. Sales were slated to begin in January through Piaggio's sales network, with the price of the minibus expected to be 35,280,000 lire ($20,700). (Rome ANSA 7 Dec 93)* Sharon W. 733-6395 (Germany) Volkswagen is preparing to market the Golf Ecomatic, the first production-model automobile that conserves fuel and reduces emissions by turning off its engine when the gas pedal is released and restarting it when the pedal is again depressed. An electronics package controls the engine and maintains safety functions such as power steering, lights, and power brakes. When the gas pedal is released, the engine stops and a servomotor engages the clutch, disconnecting the wheels from the transmission and allowing the car to continue forward by momentum alone. When the engine restarts, the car's electrical system switches to an auxiliary battery so that it is not subject to the voltage drop associated with the starter's high electrical consumption. In large urban areas, where a car's engine might be off up to 60 percent of the time, the system could reduce carbon monoxide emissions by 36 percent, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions by 25 percent, and carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent. Fuel consumption could be reduced by at least 1 liter per 100 kilometers. (Paris L'USINE NOUVELLE 2 Dec 93)* Alexis M. 733-6345 (France) Working with French automakers, the French Petroleum Institute (IFP) has developed two experimental fuel-injection techniques aimed at making the two-stroke automobile engine a viable alternative to the conventional four-stroke engine by eliminating its chief disadvantage: emissions of unburned hydrocarbons that are 10 to 20 percent higher than those of a conventional engine. One technique, a direct liquid injection procedure, allows fuel to be fully atomized just before ignition. Another, an air injection procedure developed with Peugeot, can, according to initial research, reduce hydrocarbon emissions by over 97 percent and carbon monoxide emissions by over 99 percent--enough to meet emissions standards for the year 2000. Although both procedures (which rely on pressurization) are currently expensive, the IFP hopes that the two- stroke engine's advantages--lighter weight, simpler architecture, lower cost, and greater power--will persuade auto makers to invest in further research.

Mexico has already agreed to purchase a prototype vehicle and the Italian company plans to set up a vehicle production plant in Mexico. Faam-batterie has asked the European Community for 250,000 ECU ($278,000) for market research. The recently enacted North American Free Trade Agreement will allow Mexico to export the electric vehicles to Canada or the United States without paying export duties.

It produces no harmful emissions, and the residue from the combustion process will be recycled for other industrial uses. (Rome ANSA 12 Nov 93) Brussels Bureau/Sharon W. 733-6395 (Japan) Working with Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, and Toho Gas, Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Company, Ltd. has developed a gas turbine combustor with low nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions (25 ppm NOx) with 16 percent O2 when installed in Mitsui's 1,000-kilowatt gas turbine). The Mitsui Super Premix employs a dry method called \"lean diffuse/premix two-stage combustion,\" which reduces NOx emissions by diffuse-combusting some of the fuel to stabilize the flame, then premixing most of the remaining fuel with combustion gases and eventually reducing the flame temperature for improved gross thermal and overall efficiency. The dry design eliminates maintenance and water purification problems associated with the water or steam spray method. The new combustor, which meets Tokyo's and Osaka's strict NOx regulations, is expected to encourage the use of cogeneration. Two of the combustors are operating in cogeneration systems in Sapporo City.

The treatment system cost 1.2 million marks ($687,000); the cost for a conventional system is 1.7 million marks ($974,000). Waste water recovered after aluminum etching has high concentrations of hydrochloric and sulfuric acids. Conventional water treatment systems include a neutralization phase followed by separation of liquids and solids. The liquids are released into the sewer system, while the solids are dumped. In the Heidenheim system, a membrane separates the waste water directly into two parts: one rich in hydrochloric and sulfuric acids (up to 80 percent of which can be recovered and reused) and the other rich in metals. The metal-bearing part, composed mainly of alumina salt, can be used in organic filtering to precipitate bacteria.

The facility will include new microcircuit materials fabrication equipment like that used in DuPont's British, Japanese, and US plants. By 1995, the joint venture will begin manufacturing thick-film circuits and circuit materials and other electronic devices for automotive applications, computers, and similar high-tech products for both the domestic and international markets. (Beijing RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION 20 Dec 93)* Thomas T. 733-6342 Solar Cells (Japan) Sharp Corporation has developed a 1 x 1-centimeter solar cell whose deterioration in efficiency is one-third that of conventional solar cells. The efficiency, initially 11.4 percent, dropped to a low of 10.2 percent after 300 hours of exposure to light but improved to a final 10.4 percent after another 50 hours. The 450-nanometer-thick cell consists of a layer of amorphous silicon/carbon sandwiched between two layers of amorphous silicon/germanium on a glass substrate. Researchers maintained high conversion efficiency with these thin films by changing the wavelength of incoming light. Sharp is developing a 10 x 10- centimeter prototype cell and hopes to produce 30 x 40-centimeter cells for practical application by the year 2000. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 22 Dec 93) Junko A. 733-6346 FEATURE ARTICLES ISRAEL/GERMANY/ITALY: POSSIBLE BREAKTHROUGH IN BATTERY TECHNOLOGY European tests of an Israeli-developed zinc-air battery show it gives an electric vehicle the performance and range capabilities of one powered by an internal combustion engine. Recent German and Italian press reports suggest that an Israeli- developed zinc-air battery may represent a breakthrough for electric vehicles. Tests by the German federal postal authority (the Bundespost), as well as by Italy's National Electricity Board and the Montedison company, showed that the new battery is lighter than other systems and has a long life. It is also the first battery capable of giving electric vehicles performance and range characteristics comparable to those of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. The Bundespost is so impressed that it plans to replace part of its diesel fleet with electric vehicles powered by zinc-air batteries. About five years ago, an Israeli researcher achieved a breakthrough in zinc electrode processing that led to development of the new zinc-air battery. According to a report in DIE WELT (17 Jun 93), it has long been known that zinc can be used to make high- energy-density batteries. Many small standard 1.5-volt batteries already have zinc electrodes that produce electrical energy through an oxidation process. But increasing the energy density enough to power a vehicle requires creating a much larger electrode surface area, and the very fine zinc powder needed to achieve this surface area was extremely flammable and virtually impossible to process. The Israeli researcher discovered a simple way to make nonflammable zinc powder that could be processed into porous electrodes with extremely large surface areas. When immersed in a weak alkaline solution and supplied with oxygen, these sponge-like zinc electrodes become powerful generators of electric current, achieving an energy density of 300 watt-hours per kilogram, about 10 times that of a lead battery. The Jerusalem company Electric Fuel Limited (EFL) holds the patent on the zinc powder and is licensing the process. Germany's Bundespost recently sponsored a series of tests of the EFL battery performed by the German Technical Control Board in Munich. The tests, which used a 3.5-ton electric Mercedes fitted with a 650-kilogram EFL zinc-air battery system, were described in DIE WELT (17 Jun 93) and WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE (2 Jul 93). In traffic, the test vehicle exhibited performance comparable to that of a diesel vehicle, accelerating to 50 kilometers per hour in 10 seconds and reaching speeds of up to 110 kilometers per hour. Whereas a 900- kilogram lead-gel system gave a Bundespost electric van a range of only 54 kilometers, the zinc-air batteries had sufficient charge to enable a light truck to complete a 320-kilometer mail delivery route with many stops or to allow 400-kilometer long trips in a passenger car. The oxidized zinc electrodes were then removed from the modular batteries and replaced with fresh ones. This \"refueling\" takes only three minutes with a special tool. In another test designed to assess cold-weather durability the entire test vehicle was left in a cold chamber for three days at -20 degrees Celsius. Whereas conventional batteries tend to break down when exposed to extreme cold, the EFL battery immediately supplied enough power to start and operate the vehicle. After they are removed from the battery, used electrodes can be regenerated easily in a special process. The metal is purged of oxygen and shaped into new electrodes using electrical power either from a grid or from solar cells, whichever is less expensive. The zinc batteries in the Munich test vehicle were \"refueled\" using solar power from the desert outside Jerusalem and were then flown back to Bavaria \"charged\" (DIE WELT). The Bundespost officially announced the successful Munich battery trials at the end of August 1993 (WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE). Christian Bader of Mercedes-Benz's Utility Vehicle Development department called the EFL battery \"quite outstanding.\" Gabor Benczur-Urmossy, battery specialist at the German Automotive Society, said the EFL design provides a battery whose performance \"approaches that of an internal combustion engine\" in terms of range and acceleration. A Technical Control Board study also confirmed that the EFL technology meets ecological and safety requirements \"without any restrictions,\" according to WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE. According to Bundespost calculations, the EFL battery has an efficiency of about 26 percent: higher than that of any other battery system and higher than that of a diesel engine. DIE WELT comments that the new battery is best suited for use in fleets in which all the vehicles return to a common depot where the electrodes can be replaced. Though the need for an infrastructure of electrode reprocessing facilities is cited as a possible drawback, other fleet operators such as Bundespost Telekom and various municipal works are reported to be very interested--to the extent that they will probably help finance the infrastructure (WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE). In the coming months the Lurgi Plant Construction firm in Frankfurt plans to participate in development of a reprocessing facility for zinc electrodes. Test results have been so promising that the Bundespost wants to replace part of its diesel fleet with electric vehicles powered by EFL batteries. At a press conference in late December (DIE WELT 23 Dec 93) Bundespost officials announced that starting in 1995, about 70 vehicles owned by the Bundespost and various firms and municipalities will be fitted with the new battery for field trials designed to answer some operational questions. For example, Bundespost board member Guenter Tumm said the operating costs of an EFL battery-powered vehicle should initially be about 1.40 marks (80 cents) per kilometer, but Bundespost experts are convinced that as the batteries come into more widespread use the price per kilometer could drop to .54 mark (31 cents) per kilometer by the year 2000. Bundespost consultants have estimated the procurement cost of an EFL vehicle at about 50,000 marks ($28,600), about twice that of a diesel, but likewise predict that as more electric vehicles are purchased, they will eventually become less expensive than diesels (WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE). If the field trials go well, 80 percent of the Bundespost mail delivery fleet will be electric \"within a few years,\" according to Guenter Tumm. It has not yet been decided who will build the cars and batteries for the field trials (WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE). The Bundespost says it wants to buy them, not make them. Some German automakers who had participated in the market research, including Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, have dropped out of the project to avoid further development costs. Domestic battery manufacturers such as Varta, Bosch, and Hoppecke are also described as hesitant. Bundespost official Walter Trux has said everyone will have an opportunity to bid on the project, including some foreign firms that have already demonstrated an interest in building EFL vehicles (DIE WELT 2 Jun 93). The Italian firm Montedison has already been licensed by EFL to produce batteries in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. The first series production was due to begin in Europe by the end of 1993, according to EFL chief Yehuda Harats (WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE). In addition, Montedison has contracted with the sports car manufacturer Lamborghini to build a prototype vehicle specially designed for an electric drive: a lightweight intermediate-class van with an all-plastic body. Montedison and Italy's National Electricity Board (ENEL) have run joint tests of the EFL zinc-air battery (IL S0LE-24 ORE 10 Nov 93). These tests, like those in Munich, confirmed a range of about 300 kilometers, far superior to the 180-kilometer range of sodium-sulfur batteries and the 90-kilometer range of nickel-cadmium batteries of the same weight. Some EFL batteries are being tested on the prototypes currently under development by Lamborghini. The official presentation of these electric vehicles is scheduled for the first half of 1994. Montedison plans to continue research on the battery for another two years (investments to date total about 15 billion Iire, or $8.8 million) before going on to actual industrial-scale production. The company is seeking partners for both production and marketing. Montedison's agreement with EFL also provides for joint research and for setting up an electrode reprocessing facility in Trofarello, Italy (IL SOLE-24 ORE). Sharon W. 733-6395 JAPAN: DRIVE TO DEVELOP ELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRY Japanese government agencies and private companies are developing the technologies and support infrastructure for the Japanese electric vehicle industry. Impending environmental regulations in California and other US states requiring sales of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) are spurring Japanese efforts to develop electric vehicles (EVs) competitive in performance and price with conventional vehicles. The industry's most recently developed EVs were the main attraction at the Tokyo Motor Show in October. Japanese researchers meanwhile believe that battery technology remains the key to EV development. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and its auxiliary organizations, the Environment Agency, and local governments are providing support to Japan's nascent EV industry. Government officials are supporting R&amp;D, promoting industry standards, and procuring electric vehicles in order to stimulate production. Japan's electric power companies, automobile manufacturers, battery makers, tire companies, and other firms are developing their own products to meet the tougher standards. (For previous reporting on electric vehicle development in Japan, see PERSPECTIVES Vol. 8 No. 6, 31 May 93.) MITI's Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) reportedly is promoting domestic EV industry standards compatible with international ones to facilitate international trade (DENKI SHIMBUN 23 Aug 93). An official in the Electric Power Technology Division, Public Utilities Department, of MITI's Agency of Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE), predicts that California's 1998 legislation is likely to result in large-scale popularization of EVs (SEISAN TO DENKI Jul 93). MITI has also decided to call on the United States and Europe for joint development of electric vehicles beginning in fiscal year 1994 \"in the hope of easing trade friction\" (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 25 Sep 93). MITI Promoting R&amp;D, Use, Standards MITI is seeking sharply increased funding from the Finance Ministry in fiscal year 1994 (April 1994 through March 1995) for its EV development and commercialization projects. In this second year of its 10-year, 14-billion-yen ($127 million) lithium battery development project, MITI is requesting 1.264 billion yen ($11.5 million); funding for 1993 is 685 million yen ($6.2 million). The ministry is also seeking 1.634 billion yen ($14.9 million) in 1994 for its Ecostation 2000 plan to establish a nationwide infrastructure of EV recharging facilities; 1993 funding is set at 850 million yen ($7.7 million). MITI is thus preparing to spend approximately 90 percent more on each of the projects in 1994 than it did in 1993. The ministry is also planning to fund two new projects: 100 million yen ($909,000) for research on developing hybrid electric vehicles and 3.3 billion yen ($300 million) in financing to promote the acquisition of EVs and other low-pollution vehicles and the leasing of fuel supply facilities. Preferential financing would cover half the price of acquiring the vehicles; with EV prices averaging 4 million yen ($36,400), the plan would facilitate the acquisition of 1,500 EVs (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 4 Oct 93). Through the Japan Electric Vehicle Association (JEVA), MITI has provided subsidies to local governments, power companies, and other organizations to promote the leasing of 400 electric vehicles (SEISAN TO DENKI Jul 93). MITI's request for 100 million yen to develop hybrid electric vehicles marks the start of a seven-year project to design vehicles combining an internal combustion engine with an electric motor. The ministry has tasked the Japan Automobile Research Institute (JARI), which is establishing a committee of industry representatives to survey the relevant technology during fiscal years 1994 and 1995. MITI will then oversee a subsequent five-year development phase. Hino Motors has already developed its HIMR hybrid bus, which uses electric power for starting and stopping, but MITI envisions developing hybrid EV technology that will provide power continuously. Although the overall budget and funding obligations of MITI and the project's corporate participants have not been set, total spending over the life of the project is estimated at more than one billion yen ($9 million) (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 28 Sep 93). In fiscal year 1992 MITI also began a five-year, 2.3-billion-yen project conducted by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and JARI that will develop technology for recharging stations, conduct EV fleet tests using the recharging equipment, and study how to install the necessary infrastructure (SEKIYU May 93). The MITI system consists of a battery that is charged at night; this battery then becomes the power source for a daytime EV rapid recharging stand (NIKKEI RYUTSU SHIMBUN 8 Jun 93; NEDO NEWS May 93). MITI has provided Nippon Express Co. and two other companies with electric vehicles and recharging facilities to collect data. According to NIKKEI RYUTSU SHIMBUN (8 Jun 93), in June Nippon Express began \"full-scale\" use of its recharging facilities, described as \"Japan's largest.\" In addition, a public corporation supporting MITI's Ecostation 2000 plan is conducting technical research and surveys on such topics as reducing the size of EV recharging facilities (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 17 May 93). MITI has also been promoting standardization as indispensable to the development of electric vehicles (ASAHI SHIMBUN 26 Jul 93). In 1993 JEVA formed a standardization committee, headed by a MITI official, in the Vehicle Engineering Division of AIST's Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. The committee consists of four subpanels: EV bodies, batteries, infrastructure, and Ecostations (SEKIYU May 93; NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 19 Apr 93). On 24 November MITI announced standards covering EV batteries, motors, connecting devices in recharging equipment, and other components that the ministry and JEVA had jointly devised. By 1996 these standards will become the basis for codification by AIST as Japan Industrial Standards (JIS). MITI hopes the national standards will eliminate the production of incompatible products by individual Japanese companies that have developed EV equipment according to their own standards. MITI also expects the parts standards to enable manufacturers to lower costs through mass production and to facilitate joint development among companies (YOMIURI SHIMBUN 25 Nov 93; NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 15 Jun 93). Beyond JIS, the ministry also wants to coordinate its standards with the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission in order to facilitate international trade (DENKI SHIMBUN 23 Aug 93). JEVA is reportedly conducting its domestic standardization activities while keeping an eye on overseas developments (ASAHI SHIMBUN 26 Jul 93). Meanwhile MITI will adopt the JEVA standards for its Ecostation 2000 plan, first applying them to the 13 ecostations slated for startup in fiscal year 1993 (YOMIURI SHIMBUN, NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 25 Nov 93). According to YOMIURI SHIMBUN (25 Nov 93), Japan is the first country to devise unified EV standards. With companies in Japan, the United States, and Europe pursuing their own development plans, such elements as recharging times and plug receptacles have been \"all over the board.\" Having asked Ford, Germany's Daimler-Benz, and other foreign companies to participate in devising the Japanese standards, MITI \"will call for their adoption as global standards\" and seek joint EV development as part of the US-Japanese framework talks. On 29 November, MITI announced it was setting standards for EV rapid recharging systems to be installed at conventional gas stations (YOMIURI SHIMBUN 30 Nov 93). On 17 December the Ecostation Support Association announced plans to provide 33 million yen in subsidies to each of 11 facilities to install EV recharging equipment. The association plans to allocate additional subsidies to support MITI's proposal to establish some 100 ecostations in Japan by fiscal year 1995 (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 18 Dec 93). Environment Agency Promoting EV Use The Environment Agency (EA) is also seeking to promote the use of electric vehicles in Japan. An advisory organization to EA's Air Quality Bureau published an interim report in September 1993 that proposed combating air pollution by putting 200,000 to 300,000 low- pollution vehicles, including 120,000 to 160,000 EVs, on Tokyo metropolitan area roads by the year 2000. In November the agency sent letters to 128 central and local government offices and related organizations in the Tokyo metropolitan area inquiring whether officials were considering purchasing low-pollution vehicles for the fleet of some 323,000 government vehicles. The agency, which is considering launching a new \"assistance system,\" is also contemplating using the information as a basis for consultations on switching to low-pollution vehicles (SANKEI SHIMBUN 22 Nov 93; KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 23 Sep 93; MAINICHI SHIMBUN 24 Sep 93). Local Governments Planning to Use EVs In addition to central government agencies and their auxiliary organizations, some 140 local governments throughout Japan are already procuring low-pollution vehicles. Osaka reportedly has Japan's most advanced EV support structure. Osaka's EV promotion committee, which includes the municipal and prefectural governments, Japan Storage Battery, Daihatsu Motors, Kansai Electric Power Company, and other local public and private organizations, opened the world's first rapid recharging stand in spring 1993. With aid from MITI, Osaka has to date built a total of 10 recharging stands, each within 5 kilometers of another (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 29 Jun 93; ASAHI SHIMBUN 26 Jul 93). In March 1993 the city produced its own EV operating manual and in October 1993, Osaka's prefectural government announced a tentative plan that proposes obtaining low-pollution vehicles, including EVs, for official use to reduce nitrogen oxide (N0x) pollution levels by approximately 30 percent by fiscal year 2000 (ASAHI SHIMBUN 27 Oct 93). The Osaka Science and Technology Center is meanwhile at the center of an advanced battery technology research forum involving 28 companies that is attempting to develop high-performance EV batteries (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 7 May 93). Tokyo is also incorporating electric vehicles into its plans to combat pollution. The municipal government announced on 15 November a plan to reduce the volume of NOx emissions from vehicles to 33,000 tons, approximately 63.5 percent lower than the 1990 level, by the year 2000; 6,300 tons of the total reduction is to be accomplished in cooperation with local governments in Osaka, Kanagawa, and three other areas through the introduction of 310,000 low-pollution vehicles, including 40,000 EVs and 35,000 natural gas-fueled vehicles. The city will also offer subsidies for procurement and maintenance (YOMIURI SHIMBUN 16 Nov 93; NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 16 Nov 93). But an ASAHI SHIMBUN (16 Nov 93) article noted that at that time the number of electric and natural gas vehicles combined was only 319, a far cry from the target. The article also asserted that the cost of such vehicles remains prohibitive even with subsidies covering half the price. Despite Tokyo's having budgeted subsidies for 55 low-pollution vehicles in fiscal year 1992, subsidies were requested for only five vehicles. Local governments in the Chubu region are also promoting EV use. In June 1993 Aichi Prefecture, the cities of Nagoya and Toyota, and 22 private companies formed a study group, called CEV, to examine ways to popularize EVs. The roster of companies includes: Daihatsu, Suzuki, Toyota, and four other automobile manufacturers; five battery producers; Idemitsu Kosan and five other oil/trading companies; and Chubu Electric Power and three other communications/power companies. Over a three-year period the organization will build some 10 rapid recharging stands at public utilities, supermarket parking lots, and existing fuel supply centers to support the trial operation of approximately 100 vehicles. The models to be used are EV versions of existing vans: Daihatsu's Hijet, Suzuki's Carry, and Toyota's Townace (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 2 Jun 93; SEISAN TO DENKI Jul 93; ASAHI SHIMBUN 3 Jun 93; NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 3 Jun 93). CEV members will use a magnetized card that enters the vehicle's voltage and current specifications into the recharging stand's vehicle signal system; a vehicle will recharge in 30 minutes to over 50 percent of its capacity (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 Dec 93). CEV is implementing its plan in cooperation with the local gasoline stations chosen by MITI as model enterprises for Ecostation 2000 (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 8 Dec 93). Electric Vehicles Stars of Tokyo Motor Show Electric vehicles took center stage this year at the 35th Tokyo Motor Show hosted by the MITI-affiliated Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association from 24 October to 5 November (KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 24 Sep 93; NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 21 Oct 93). All nine Japanese car makers displayed EVs, which the NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN article refers to as the industry's \"trump card of environmental measures\" (NIKKEI MATERIALS &amp; TECHNOLOGY Dec 93). NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN (21 Oct 93) also noted that hybrid vehicles combining battery technology with other power sources were the mainstream\" EV offerings. Daihatsu Motor Company for example, displayed its 660-cubic-centimeter engine EV Sedan (NIKKEI MECHANICAL 13 Dec 93). Honda Motor Company unveiled its EVX, which has a top speed of 130 kilometers per hour and features an auxiliary battery powered by roof-top solar panels as well as a three-speed automatic transmission. Suzuki's EE-10, which combines electric power with a 660-cubic-centimeter methanol engine, will feature a sodium-sulfur battery that Yuasa Corporation is now developing (NIKKEI MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY Dec 93). Mitsubishi Motor Corporation's ESR uses the Series Hybrid Electric system, which combines an alkaline battery with a compact AC induction motor and motor controllers, a 1,500-cubic-centimeter internal combustion engine for generating electricity, an AC generator, an energy regenerative braking system that converts the kinetic energy in braking for battery use, and roof-top solar cells. GRAPHIC: color photo of ESR The ESR operates both by battery alone and in hybrid mode when the battery runs low and has reportedly reached a top speed of 200 kilometers per hour and a maximum cruising range of over 500 kilometers at 40 kilometers per hour (JAPAN 21ST Dec 93). (For photographs of the Daihatsu EV Sedan, Honda EVX, and Suzuki EE-10, see PERSPECTIVES Vol. 8 No. 11, 30 Nov 93.) Automakers Aiming for US Market Japanese corporations have been developing electric vehicles with the US market in mind. Analysts for the automobile technical journal JIDOSHA KOGAKU (Oct 93) and NIKKEI ELECTRONICS (20 Dec 93) note that EVs are the only viable option capable of meeting the stringent California requirements for zero-emission vehicles, given the present state of automotive technology. One analyst estimates that each Japanese company must sell at least 700 EVs to comply with 1998 California requirements that 2 percent of all cars sold there be nonpolluting. He says Japan's auto industry is aiming to develop products for fall 1997 to meet the 1998 deadline. Daihatsu has the industry lead in building a mass production system for electric vehicles. With over 90 percent of Japan's registered on-road EVs, Daihatsu Shatai (Daihatsu Auto Body), the company's wholly-owned subsidiary and manufacturer of Daihatsu's Hijet van series, reportedly is the only Japanese company with mass- production capability. It plans to produce 400 EVs in fiscal year 1993, approximately 20 percent more than it produced in 1992. Moreover, Daihatsu Shatai is strengthening joint R&amp;D with its parent corporation to develop dedicated EV auto body and recharging technology (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 3 Jul 93). Counting on government assistance, Daihatsu is planning to expand annual production to 10,000 vehicles by 1995 or 1996. In May the company announced plans to develop a one- or two-seat EV measuring about 3 meters long by 1 meter wide, weighing less than 500 kilograms, and featuring a top speed of around 100 kilometers per hour. Priced at under 1 million yen ($9,000), the car would sell for about one-third the price of the cheapest EVs to date. Daihatsu's vehicle \"appears to be the trump card\" of MITI's plan to have 200,000 EVs on the road by the year 2000, according to ASAHI SHIMBUN (26 May 93), which also noted that MITI will seek the relaxation of tax, registration, and licensing regulations in order to stimulate sales. On 19 October Daihatsu and Kansai Electric Power Company (KEPCO) announced the joint development of an experimental four-wheel mini EV intended for light commercial transport or personal shopping. The vehicle, an improved version of the three-wheel mini-EV KEPCO developed in 1989, is 2.4 meters long by 1 meter wide, and weighs 440 kilograms; it reaches a top speed of 60 kilometers per hour and features a fiber-reinforced plastic body and a sealed, six-cell lead battery capable of powering the vehicle for a distance of 70 kilometers on a single charge (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN, NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN, YOMIURI SHIMBUN 20 Oct 93). Daihatsu plans to begin selling the vehicle in two years for under 1 million yen ($9,000) (HOKKAIDO SHIMBUN 20 Oct 93). Daihatsu also hopes to begin selling an improved EV Hijet van with a low-maintenance lead battery in March 1994. The new version will house a computer system to monitor the battery's electrolytic solution, automatically adding distilled water from an on-vehicle tank when necessary (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 4 May 93). Daihatsu relies on government procurement of official vehicles for sales of its EVs. For example, Daihatsu EV engineer Ariyoshi noted that the MITI-affiliated Japan Electric Vehicle Association has long provided support through its \"test-drive system.\" In addition, the Environment Agency's subsidies to local governments for the purchase of electric vehicles has resulted in a modest rise in local government EV procurement, according to a Daihatsu engineer. Local governments accounted for nearly half the sales of Daihatsu's 465 Hijet electric vans from 1990 to 1992. Japan's electric power companies and the quasi-public Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. accounted for another quarter of the total (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 24 Jul 93; JIDOSHA GIJUTSU Aug 93). Japan's press has been reporting relatively little on EV development efforts by Toyota and Nissan--Japan's Big Two automobile manufacturers--compared with its coverage of government EV policies and Daihatsu's activities. Within the industrial group centered around Toyota, a number of companies--including the previously mentioned member company Daihatsu--are developing EV technology (JAPAN COMPANY HANDB0OK, FIRST SECTION 5 Nov 93). Nissan is reported to be planning to sell 50 Cedric EVs a year beginning as early as December 1993 at a cost of 2 to 2.4 million yen ($18,200 to $21,800) apiece (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 16 Apr 93); recharging equipment costing around one million yen ($9,000) will also be sold. Battery Technology Key to EV Development According to a NIKKEI ELECTRONICS (20 December 93) analyst, automotive experts, including most Japanese battery makers, believe that breakthroughs in battery technology are necessary to popularize electric vehicles. Sealed lead batteries are the \"most likely candidates\" to power the first Japanese EVs in the fall of 1997 to meet California's initial requirements for zero emission vehicles, but the increasing number of EV sales required by 2003 (10 percent of vehicles sold) will necessitate batteries with better performance. The analyst reports that Japan's battery makers, including those conducting R&amp;D on nickel metal hydride batteries, see lithium as the follow-on technology to nickel metal hydride (NIKKEI ELECTRONICS 20 Dec 93). Furukawa Battery, Matsushita Battery Industrial, Sanyo Electric, and other companies are developing nickel metal hydride battery technology. Honda, whose Tokyo Motor Show display included a nickel metal hydride battery developed by Ovonic Battery Company and Matsushita Battery Industrial, recently concluded an agreement with Ovonic for joint development of a next-generation nickel metal hydride battery for use in Honda electric vehicles (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 12 Jan 94). An unidentified source from a battery manufacturer complains nevertheless that nickel metal hydride battery costs are three to four times those of lead batteries for less than twice the energy density. An anonymous Matsushita Battery Industrial Company source notes that his company must find ways to lower the battery temperature during recharging and to lengthen the battery's short life span (NIKKEI ELECTRONICS 20 Dec 93). MITI is already pursuing lithium battery technology. NEDO, an organization under the auspices of MITI, is conducting a 10-year lithium battery R&amp;D project (1992-2000) through the Engineering Research Association for Lithium Battery Energy Storage Technology (LIBES). The Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI), a public corporation under ANRE's administration, has oversight responsibility for \"total system research.\" Ten companies are responsible for the following areas of research: Long-life battery R&amp;D: Hitachi Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Sanyo Electric Co., Yuasa Battery Co. High-energy-density battery R&amp;D: Japan Storage Battery Co., Matsushita Battery Industrial Co., Nippondenso Co., Toshiba Corp. Materials R&amp;D: Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Osaka Gas Co. (NEDO NEWS May 93) A Japanese journalist, reporting on the contract signed in December by the US firm Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, the US Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory, and the Canadian utility Hydro-Quebec to develop a thin-film lithium polymer battery for the US Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC), speculated that Yuasa Corporation's links to Hydro-Quebec could permit the Japanese company \"to join indirectly in the USABC development project.\" Yuasa and Hydro-Quebec agreed in January 1992 to work together to develop a lithium polymer battery by 1998 (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 17 Dec 93). Sodium-sulfur batteries have some advantages over nickel metal hydride ones. They currently have an energy density of 100 watt- hours per kilogram, or 2.5 times that of conventional lead batteries. Sodium-sulfur batteries also have an output density of 150 watts per kilogram and a life span of 1,000 cycles, which is comparable to that of lead batteries. Yuasa's sodium-sulfur battery for the Suzuki EE-10 sandwiches a beta-type alumina (beta-Al203) between a sodium anode and a sodium-sulfur (Na2Sx) electrode (NIKKEI MATERIALS &amp; TECHNOLOGY Dec 93). GRAPHIC: color photo of sodium-sulfur battery Working with Japan Storage Battery, Nissan has also developed the SQC-N, a sealed nickel-cadmium battery with an energy density of 55 watt-hours per kilogram. The SQC-N, capable of a 40-percent rapid recharge in six minutes, is featured in the experimental Nissan FEV electric car (KINO ZAIRYO Sep 93). Kyushu Electric Power Company and Tokyo R&amp;D, which has designed and produced Tokyo Electric Power Company's IZA and Chubu Electric Power Company's Dream Mini (shown below), have developed a miniature EV that features a nickel-zinc battery developed by Kyushu Electric and Yuasa Corporation. With twice the energy density of conventional lead batteries, the new battery gives the vehicle a maximum range of about 175 kilometers, roughly one-third better than the 130 kilometers possible with lead batteries. Kyushu Electric and Yuasa are now working to extend the battery's life, which is only half that of lead batteries. Kyushu Electric Power Research Institute, the utility's affiliated R&amp;D company, is also seeking to stretch the life of nickel-zinc batteries from the present 70 cycles to 400 cycles. Kyushu Electric is planning to market the vehicle in 1996 (JIDOSHA KOGAKU Oct 93; DENKI SHIMBUN 23 Aug, 14 Oct 93; NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 15 Oct 93; ASAHI SHIMBUN 17 Oct 93; NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 17 Aug 93). GRAPHIC: b/w photo of Dream Mini A team of researchers from the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Matsushita Electric Industrial Company is developing a thin-film battery with composite electrodes using an organic sulfur compound; the new battery lasts ten times as long as nickel-cadmium batteries (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 7 Oct 93). EV-Related Products Japanese companies are also developing EV-related products. Yokohama Rubber Company has fabricated a low-resistance tire for a light van developed by Mitsubishi Motors and Tokyo Electric Power Company. Yokohama Rubber, using its light-truck tires as a base, devised a new compound and structure to make 10-percent lighter tires with 30 percent less rolling resistance. The company reportedly sees its deal with Mitsubishi as a way to catch up to Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber Company, which had previously begun deliveries of EV tires to Toyota and Nissan (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 22 Jun 93). In April 1993 Bridgestone announced its Ecopia EV tire, which also incorporates a new rubber compound and design, has 30 percent less rolling resistance, and is 10 percent lighter than the company's previous tires (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 27 Apr 93). In October 1993 Nihon Protector introduced a waterproof, on- vehicle recharging device for electric vehicles. The device, which employs \"direct high-frequency switching\" technology, measures 50 x 26 x 16 centimeters, weighs 17 kilograms, and plugs into a 2OO-volt, 30-ampere AC outlet. The recharging mechanism can power an EV for approximately 40 kilometers on a one-hour charge and 10 kilometers on a 15-minute charge. Nihon Protector hopes to begin selling the device in the summer of 1994 to automobile companies and other customers at a price of under 100,000 yen ($910) (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 8 Jan, 21 Oct 93).

NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN (29 Jun 93), for example, has described expectations in Japan that EVs will play the \"main role\" among low-pollution vehicles. ANRE official Keiichi Yumoto, has called for a comprehensive national policy on EVs (SEISAN TO DENKI Jul 93). Some industry representatives have nevertheless questioned the benefits of electric vehicles. INFODIA (Oct 93), a Mitsubishi Corporation journal, recently published an article asserting that higher vehicle prices and potential pollution problems resulting from battery disposal and increased consumption of electrical power cast doubt on the real value of electric vehicles. The article postulated that Japanese companies were developing EVs simply to prove their environmental credentials while continuing to sell conventional automobiles in the United States. A NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN (21 Oct 93) article suggested that full conversion to electric vehicles is not feasible because of high electrical consumption. Other commentators have suggested strategies by which Japan could develop and \"cash in on\" the low-pollution vehicle industry. Asahi Research Center, the think tank of Asahi Chemical Industry Co., has proposed that MITI accelerate its EV development timetable to avoid losing market share in international competition and has called on MITI to concentrate recharging stands in selected cities rather than both in cities and along highways, as the ministry's plan proposes (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 18 May 93). An unidentified executive in Yamato Transport Co., which had begun trial operation of 13 low- pollution vehicles, suggested encouraging the purchase of EVs by providing \"administrative assistance\" (YOMIURI SHIMBUN 1 Jun 93). A MAINICHI SHIMBUN (28 Sep 93) editorial recently urged the government to direct its environmental regulations and preferential policies to the popularization of low-pollution vehicles. Stephen M. 733-6343 JAPAN: LOW-POLLUTION VEHICLES Japanese industries, backed by government financing, are promoting the development and marketing of low-pollution vehicles. Japanese automobile manufacturers and electric power and gas companies have been cooperating in government-backed efforts to promote the development and sale of low-pollution automobiles, including those that use natural gas, hydrogen, methanol, solar power, electric batteries and combinations of these as energy sources. Much of the current effort focuses on natural gas vehicles. Much of the current Japanese effort to promote the development and sale of low-pollution automobiles focuses on natural gas vehicles, which use methane-based city gas, and which are categorized according to method of fuel storage: compressed natural gas vehicles (CNGVs), liquefied natural gas vehicles (LNGVs), and absorption natural gas vehicles (ANGVs). As of November 1993, there were 123 natural gas vehicles (NGVs) in use in Japan, mostly owned by city gas companies; eighteen of them are leased to local governments under the auspices of the Ministry of Transport. Most of the NGVs operating in Japan are CNGV types (ENERGY Nov 93). Osaka Gas Company plans to help encourage the use of NGVs by increasing the number of refueling stations in Kinki region from two to six, with a total of 10 new stations to be built in the country by 1995 at an estimated cost of 100 to 150 million yen ($900,000 to $1.3 million) each. The company also aims to increase the number of NGVs in use in the corporate sector from 54 to 300 vehicles by 1995 (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 8 Dec 93). In early June Osaka Gas improved the output of an NGV test engine to approximately 95 percent of gasoline engine output by enlarging the Venturi diameter of the fuel supply mixer from the traditional 22 millimeters to 28 millimeters and by raising the compression ratio from 9.2:1 to 12:1. The test engine was a four-cylinder water-cooled four-stroke in-line spark- ignition engine with a displacement of 1,468 cubic centimeters (KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 7 Jun 93). Tokyo Gas Company doubled its fiscal year 1993 budget to 1 billion yen ($9 million) to promote the practical application of NGV technology. Osaka Gas, Toho Gas, and Tokyo Gas plan to allocate a total budget of some 2 billion yen ($18 million) for NGV promotion in fiscal year 1994. Tokyo Gas plans to procure 86 NGVs, 64 for its own use and 22 for other organizations to conduct fleet tests in fiscal year 1993. The company is to procure about 600 additional NGVs by the end of fiscal year 1995 (KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 17 Feb 93). Nissan Diesel Motor Company and Nippon Carburetor Company are researching ways to address some of the problems associated with CNG engines. To keep the gas pressure high enough to run the engine smoothly, the companies designed a special mixer based on electronic fuel injection equipment developed for gasoline-powered engines and a regulator that adjusts the pressure between the cylinder and the intake manifold. A microelectronic chip was installed in a CNG bus engine to maintain the fuel/air ratio at a constant level and a turbocharger was used to boost horsepower to a maximum of 235. In Nissan's road tests of the new CNG bus, NOx and CO2 emissions were reduced by 68 percent and 2 to 3 percent, respectively, compared with diesel engines (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 15 Dec 93). GRAPHIC: Line drawing of a CNG lean-burn engine Working with Cataler Industrial Company, Toyota Motor Corporation has developed a catalyst that absorbs NOx using lean-burn technology. More than 60 percent of the NOx is removed from exhaust and fuel efficiency improves by 2 to 4 percent when using the catalyst. The catalyst is a porous material to which alkaline rare- earth metals and precious metals such as platinum and rhodium adhere. The companies have tested the catalyst for its purification efficiency, reliability and service life and plan to use it with 1,600-cc-, 1,800-cc- and 2,O0O-cc-class Carina lean-burn engines (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN, NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 26 Nov 93). Automobile manufacturers have also been accelerating the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles. For example, Mazda Motor Corporation hopes to roadtest a hydrogen-fueled vehicle with a rotary engine by 1995 and to market the vehicle by the year 2000. GRAPHIC: Color photo of Mazda rotary engine CAPTION: Mazda hopes to market a vehicle with this type of engine by 1995 The company's Kapera Cargo model, whose performance matches that of Mazda's HR-X2 hydrogen-powered prototype (exhibited at the Tokyo Motor Show in October) (see PERSPECTIVES Vol. 8 No. 11, 30 Nov 93), is slated for testing at Nippon Steel Corporation's Hirohata Ironworks. Mazda also recently tested its newly developed vehicle powered by a hydrogen fuel cell (JIDOSHA GIJUTSU Aug 93; NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 18 Nov 93). The Japanese government has increased funding for projects to popularize low-pollution vehicles. The table below compares MITI's fiscal year 1993 expenditures to its fiscal year 1994 budget requests for these projects, including three new ventures (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 4 Oct 93). (For previous reporting on efforts to develop Japan's electric vehicle industry, see PERSPECTIVES Vol. 8 No. 6, 31 May 93.)

Finance Corp. *** Denotes new venture The first of MITI's new ventures involves the development of hybrid electric vehicles, whereas the other two seek to popularize low-pollution vehicles. For example MITI has requested 100 million yen ($900,000) to subsidize half the cost of converting gasoline- powered cars to natural gas for auto leasing companies, with the Japan Gas Association acting as the intermediary. The ministry is also lobbying for 3.3 billion yen ($9.6 million) for the leasing of fuel supply facilities and for low-rate financing to encourage the purchase of some 1,500 low-pollution vehicles beginning in 1994 at an average cost of 4 million yen ($36,000) each (for an electric vehicle). MITI's FY94 funding, if approved by the Ministry of Finance, will total 8.33 billion yen ($75 million), nearly three times the FY93 expenditure of 3.058 billion yen ($27.5) (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 7 Oct 93; NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 4 Oct 93). Japan's Environment Agency also plans to establish a policy on low-pollution automobile technologies by the end of 1994 to channel car makers' R&amp;D efforts into vehicles that comply with stringent zero-emissions requirements being implemented in the United States. The Ministry of Transport is meanwhile scheduled to begin a four- year plan to develop technologies to convert diesel trucks to compressed natural gas vehicles next year (KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 5 Nov 93, 1 Dec 93). Ritsuko G. 733-6333/Stephen M. 733-6343 REPORTS REPORTS surveys science and technology trends as detailed in articles, books, and journals. It also includes summaries and listings of articles and books that may serve as potential sources for future research. EUROPE: CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO LOW-POLLUTION VEHICLES Tougher clean-air standards to be implemented in both California and Europe by the year 2000 will dictate the sale of zero-emission and ultralow-emission vehicles. European automakers are taking a cautious approach in preparing for the new standards. In many cases this means converting conventional models to electric drive; in other cases it means designing scaled-down models with smaller, less polluting internal combustion engines. The most advanced designs, now on the drawing boards, will not be marketed before the year 2000. Uncertain consumer acceptance, the absence of a recharging infrastructure, and lack of batteries capable of providing satisfactory range have combined with high price tags to cause many European automakers to take a conservative approach to electric vehicles, according to an article in INDUSTRIES ET TECHNIQUES (Nov 93). Even large companies have tended to do no more than electrify the smallest of their utility-vehicle production models and produce them in limited numbers. Utility vehicles are relatively easy to convert, because they are technically less sophisticated and better able to accommodate today's heavy, bulky batteries. Renault plans to begin series production of its Master model in March 1994 and its Express model in October of the same year, although neither production line will exceed 1,000 vehicles per year. Both are powered by lead-gel batteries. Electric versions of the Renault Clio and Peugeot's 106 and AX models, slated to hit showrooms in 1995, will be produced only in very limited numbers as well. The Clio and the 106, four-seat passenger cars with in-city ranges of 80 and 90 kilometers respectively, are powered by nickel- cadmium batteries. The 106 and AX models will be tested by 50 drivers in La-Rochelle for a year and a half prior to their launch on the market. During this time the city will also be able to test its network of smart-card recharging stations that will provide slow charging at parking lots and fast charging at selected gas stations. GRAPHIC: color photo of electric Peugeot 106 Renault, Citroen, and Fiat all have cars on the drawing board that are designed for electric propulsion (the Zoom, the Citela, and the Downtown) but have no immediate plans for series production and marketing. Other companies, such as BMW, have designed cars with hybrid electric and internal combustion drives (see PERSPECTIVES Vol. 7 No. 4, 30 Apr 92). In all cases, price is a problem. Demand remains low, so production numbers will be few, keeping prices high. The table below lists new European designs for passenger vehicles planned for introduction in the year 2000.

Small cars are a familiar tradition for most European automakers, but some builders of large luxury cars are having to design scaled-down models for the first time. The Vision A minivan (shown below), a Mercedes designed to compete with vehicles such as the Renault Twingo, is slated to hit the market around 1996. Its engine, a three-cylinder, 1.2-liter, 55-horsepower experimental model, is under the passengers' feet. The Vision A's under-floor area can also accommodate a nickel chloride/sodium battery pack, a 54-horsepower asynchronous motor, an electronic control module, and bulky cooling equipment for the electric version. The prototype has an aluminum body, which saves about 70 kilograms in weight compared with conventional steel structures. However, Mercedes admits an aluminum body will not be feasible for the production model, so the fuel economy will be less spectacular than the city/highway average of 3.8 liters per 100 kilometers (about 62 miles per gallon) claimed for the diesel-powered prototype. GRAPHIC: color photo of Vision A The Vision A by Mercedes is 3.35 meters long, 1.66 meters wide, 1.57 meters high, and weighs 715 kilograms (gasoline version) or 735 kilograms (diesel version) Ioan M. 733-6334 NETHERLANDS/GERMANY: CLEAN MANUFACTURING FOR ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY Siemens' Laboratory for Production Techniques in Oostkamp, Netherlands is designing environmentally friendly processes for manufacturing electronic subassemblies. According to an article in the December 1993 issue of the Dutch publication TECHNIVISIE, researchers began a project in 1988 to develop environmentally friendly materials for manufacturing electrical appliances, which led to the development of injection-molded components with integrated conductive paths. The technology combines the functions of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) shielding, heat removal, and conductors between connector pins using a strong, heat-resistant, injectable plastic. Researchers metallized the plastic with a copper layer, developed a three-dimensional conductor using a laser-based process, and designed a method to solder without causing damage. Siemens uses the technology to fabricate the substrate for a programmable logic control (PLC) circuit. Siemens' new method of PLC fabrication offers significant advantages compared with the previous technique. The new process reduces the number of components from 11 to just one, and it uses only two materials--copper and plastic--both of which are recyclable. Siemens' process is also shorter and the company expects lower production costs if it can mass-produce the PLCs. A fourth advantage of this new process is that 100-micron laser structuring allows direct integration of surface-mounted devices, bare integrated circuits, or microengineering components. Siemens has yet to produce a prototype PLC but plans to do so using stereolithography. Researchers are optimistic about the method's marketability, and even though it remains in the design phase, Siemens at Oostkamp has offered to teach other electronics manufacturers how to integrate the new fabrication method into their own products. Siemens researchers have also developed a new software package that analyzes the environmental impact of various electronic assembly manufacturing processes. The software is designed to help manufacturers and distributors of electrical and electronic appliances ensure that their products are completely recyclable in compliance with Germany's January 1994 recycling legislation. Siemens-Nixdorf has already begun marketing the new software. Renee McG. 733-6339 CHINA: ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY CARBON/CARBON COMPOSITE Researchers in the Materials Science and Engineering Department at Northwest Polytechnical University (NPU) in Xian have developed a crosslinking catalytic method to modify the matrix of domestic industrial mesothermal (coal tar) pitch, which results in an improved carbon/carbon (C/C) composite. The NPU method, described in an article in the Beijing technical journal GAO JISHU TONGXUN (Sep 93), will not damage equipment and is not harmful to human health. The method rearranges the small-molecule hydrocarbons (arenes) in the pitch matrix into a large planar molecular network, increasing the carbon-to-hydrogen ratio (C/H) and improving the carbon yield. The method also results in greater compressive strength at both room temperature and high temperatures. The composite--which exhibits better material integrity, lower porosity, and better heat resistance than earlier-generation composites--is made from the modified pitch as matrix precursor by constant-pressure soaking and carbonization technology. The technique uses industrial mesothermal pitch (softening temperature 82 degrees Celsius, average molecular weight 460) made by the Wuzhu Steel Company. The test agents are commercially pure chemical reagents. The pitch is first pulverized, then mixed with the cross-linking catalyst--idealIy formaldehyde monomer or para- toluene sulfonic acid--and dissolved in a solvent. This is done in argon where the solution is heated in an oil bath and then rapidly cooled. For comparison, both modified and unmodified pitch are used as matrix precursors. They are soaked, then carbonized to make two different C/C composites. Both composites are analyzed for C/H value, carbon yield, softening point, and weight-loss onset temperature (thermal gravimetric analysis), as well as for compressive strength at both room temperature (90-degree direction) and high temperature (900 degrees Celsius, 90-degree direction, in air). Results are given in the table below. Pitch Properties, Before and After Modification C/H Carbon Softening Temp. at Compressive (atomic yield point onset of strength (MPa) ratio) (%) (deg.

Thomas T. 733-6342 JAPAN: CLEAN ENERGY POLICY, EXPENDITURES Japanese government ministries are departing from their usual inter-ministerial squabbling over policy and budget issues and are cooperating to promote the application of new energy technologies such as photovoltaic power generation and clean-energy vehicles. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MITI), the Ministry of Construction (MOC), the Ministry of Transport (MOT), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and the Environment Agency (EA) are jointly proposing strategies for a low-interest loan system to encourage commercialization of low-pollution vehicles and for the incorporation of photovoltaic power and other energy conservation systems into residential housing. MITI and MHA are also intensifying their efforts to promote wind power generation and the use of waste materials to generate power. The fiscal year 1993 Science and Technology Research Survey report published by the Management and Coordination Agency in the Office of the Prime Minister says that fiscal year 1992 energy research expenditures totaled some 1.05 trillion yen ($9.4 billion), a 7.4-percent increase over the fiscal year 1991 figure. More than 8,000 organizations, including companies capitalized at over 100 million yen and scientific research organizations and universities, participate in the agency's annual survey. The following table shows fiscal year 1992 energy research expenditures. Research Area Fiscal Year 1992 Expenditure (billion yen) Fossil energy 95.1 Petroleum 46.2 Natural gas 7.3 Coal 35.2 Other 6.4 Natural energy 35.6 Geothermal 4 Solar 22 Ocean 1.3 Wind 1.5 Biomass 4.9 Other 1.9 Nuclear energy 488.2 Power generation 205.3 Multipurpose reactors 16.7 Nuclear fuel cycle 109.5 Nuclear fusion 50.1 Nuclear powered ships 1.7 Radiation use 26.6 Radiation safety 42.7 Other 35.6 Energy conservation 411.2 Industrial sector 41.5 Home affairs 40.8 Transportation 254.5 Energy conservation/storage 54.1 Hydrogen energy 7.4 Other 12.9 Other 17.8 Total 1,047.9 (KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 3 Dec 93, 14 Dec 93) Junko A. 733-6346 JAPAN: FUEL CELLS Fuel cells convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy, producing electric power from the chemical reaction between the electrolyte and fossil fuel. Because fuel cells require no steam cycle, they are efficient power generators, reaching about 80- percent efficiency when exhaust heat is added. Fuel cell-powered facilities can be located inland because the cells require no cooling water. They create a minimum amount of noise and emit little carbon dioxide (CO2) or nitrogen oxide (NOx) (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93. Fuel cells are thought to have considerable potential for use in large power plants, cogeneration systems, on-site public and residential facilities, and electric vehicles. So far, 76 phosphoric acid-type fuel cell power plants (18,500 kilowatts) have been installed in Japan (NIKAAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93). Led by MITI's Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), fuel cell development projects have been under way since 1981. The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), a MITI-affiliated R&amp;D organization, is actually responsible for granting R&amp;D contracts to various companies and research corporations (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93). Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFCs) have been the object of the most intensive development and testing in Japan. Two 200-kilowatt normal-pressure PAFC pilot plants--one in Osaka and the other on Okinawa--have operated continuously for 13,000 hours and 8,500 hours, respectively. A 5,O00-kilowatt pressurized-type fuel cell power plant under construction at Kansai Electric Power Company's Amagasaki Technoland is scheduled to begin operating in fiscal year 1994. A 1,O0O-kilowatt normal pressure on-site plant is being built at the Tokyo Gas Co. Research Institute and is scheduled for operation in fiscal year 1995. In addition, some thirty 50- to 100- kilowatt plants will have been constructed by 31 March 1994 for field tests (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93). The LP Gas Promotion Center and Fuji Electric Co. have developed a 100-kilowatt prototype PAFC plant that uses butane as fuel. Butane is about 10 percent cheaper than propane, and propane can also be used for the fuel cells designed for butane. Previous problems of damage to the reformer catalyst caused by the use of butane have been solved by substituting a special precious metal catalyst. The efficiency of the butane fuel cell is expected to be about 40 percent, generally the same as that of natural gas or propane gas fuel cells. Overall development cost is estimated at 550 million yen (about $5 million), including evaluation tests on design and operation scheduled for 1994 (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 22 Dec 93). After PAFCs, the next type of fuel cell targeted for development is expected to be the molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC). In fiscal year 1994 NEDO is scheduled to begin development of a 1,000-kilowatt power plant based on MCFC technology (KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 9 Sep 93). NEDO recently claimed a world-record 129 kilowatts of electric power generated using a stack of 102 MCFC cells with electrode areas of 1 square meter (see PERSPECTIVES Vol. 8 No. 11, 30 Nov 93). At the same time, NEDO tested a normal-pressure internal-reformer-type cell stack with electrode areas of 0.5 square meters in which natural gas can be used; this stack generated 33 kilowatts. NEDO has also operated a 5-kilowatt internal-reformer-type cell stack for more than 10,000 continuous hours with a voltage drop of 0.5 percent per 1,000 hours (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93). MITI's AIST and its MCFC Power Generation System Technology Consortium have succeeded in putting MCFCs to practical use. The consortium includes equipment manufacturers and utility companies (see table). A 100-kilowatt MCFC plant located at the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry's Akagi Experimental Center in Gunma Prefecture achieved 0.8 volt per square centimeter of electrode area and 150 milliamperes of current for 1,000 hours of operation. Even then, electric output dropped by a little over 1 percent. The Consortium was to begin drafting a design for the world's first 1,O0O-kilowatt experimental plant by the end of 1993. The electricity generated is expected to cost 14 to 15 yen (about 13 cents) per kilowatt and power generation efficiency should reach 54 percent, with an overall energy efficiency of 76 percent--figures that are thought to be commercially viable (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 8 Nov 93). Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have a power generation efficiency of 60 percent, about 1.5 times that of large thermal power plants. Not only do they emit almost no NOx, but exhaust heat temperature is high, making them ideal for cogeneration systems in urban areas (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 24 Dec 93). Basic research and development of S0FCs started in fiscal year 1989 and was aimed at developing a flat-plate cell stack capable of generating more than 10 kilowatts by fiscal year 1997. A 500-watt stack is now being developed using cells with an electrode area of 200 square centimeters (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93). Osaka Gas Company is working toward producing a 5-kilowatt cell module prototype in 1995. According to NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN (14 Dec 93), Chubu Electric Power Company and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries have claimed a record in generating power continuously for 7,000 hours using two stacks of 7.5- x 7.5-centimeter advanced SOFCs. These cells feature monolithic layers of electrolyte, fuel electrode (cathode), and air electrode (anode). This reduces the surface area of electrodes coming into contact with one another by half, thereby decreasing the drop in power output to 1/10 that of conventional SOFCs. Each cell has a projected electrode area of 25 square centimeters, resulting in a 0.5-watt output density--three times that of conventional SOFCs. Meanwhile Toho Gas Company has claimed a world record for output density, achieving 1.61 watts per square centimeter for a single cell test-produced for a flat-plate SOFC stack (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 27 Dec 93). Initial research for solid polymer fuel cells, or proton exchange membranes, under way since fiscal year 1992, is aimed at development of 1-kilowatt cell technology by fiscal year 1995. At present a 200- watt stack of cells with electrode areas of 100 square centimeters is being developed (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93). For fuel cells to be commercially viable, both longevity and performance must meet certain standards. In December 1993, a report on the prospects for clean energy by the Advisory Committee on Energy and ANRE's Electricity Utility Industry Council estimated a fuel-cell-generated power supply of 160,000 kilowatts in the year 2000. This figure was in sharp contrast to a June 1990 estimate of 1.2 million kilowatts. According to ANRE, the 1990 estimate badly misjudged the technical difficulty of dealing with cell longevity. The objective was a life of 40,000 hours (five years) for a cell stack and reformer catalyst, but the best achieved so far is 15,000 hours of operation at 0.08 watt per square centimeter in 1987 (KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 6, 13 Dec 93).

It also contains recommendations on certain projects which the Council examined in detail in 1992. For future budgets, as for the budget adopted in 1992, CNRS has distinguished between companion appropriations and the budgets proper of GANIL [Large National Heavy Ion Accelerator] and Saturne. This methodology, which conforms to that practiced by the ministry and other agencies, significantly affects the figures in the following tables. General Observations Developments in 1991-1992 Expenditures for TGEs, exclusive of personnel costs, totaled 2,150 million French francs [Fr] in 1992; the corresponding figure for 1991 was Fr2,000 million (cf. 1992 report). Thus, absolute spending (without adjusting for inflation) increased by 7.5 percent. Although CNRS outlays remained practically unchanged (cf. Table 2), CEA's dropped sharply (-94 million) by reason of serious budgetary problems in 1992. The net increase [i.e. for TGEs] was due principally to the space sector (+147 million for CNES) and to the Fr38 million voluntary contribution made to CERN, without which spending in that category would have remained unchanged. The apparent decline of personnel outlays (Fr926 million in 1992 versus Fr965 million in 1991) is due solely to a change in the method used by IN2P3 to determine the sums allocated to TGEs: The old method added in both the budgets proper of the TGE facilities and the primarily personnel-related expenditures allocated to the laboratories. These latter are now more correctly included under companion appropriations (see part three of this report). 1993-1992 Compared Nonpersonnel outlays rose from Fr2,150 million in 1992 to Fr2,328 million in 1993. The Fr178 million increase (up 8.3 percent) is again due primarily to the steady growth of space programs (+ 157 million), especially ENVISAT-1, but in lesser degree to restoration of the CEA budget to its previous level (+20 million, principally for Super Torus). Start-up costs for Project VIRGO are responsible for the Fr32 million augmentation of CNRS's budget. Absolute spending on personnel was unchanged at about Fr925 million. Post-1993 Projections Nonpersonnel spending is programmed to increase by Fr115 million between 1993 and 1994 (from 2,328 million to Fr2,443 million). For the first time in many years, the augmentation is not due to space programs, which are slated only for moderate growth (+20 million). CNRS outlays are scheduled for a substantial increase (+53 million), primarily because of Project VIRGO (+59 million), the agency's other programs remaining at the previous level or even declining, as in the case of ILL [Laue Langevin Institute], which is down Fr13 million in light of new accords between the three partners. Should construction of the LHC at CERN not get under way in 1994, the authorization in the CERN budget for this project (about Fr60 million) will be reviewed. For out-years, no growth in spending is programmed (Fr2,455 million in 1995), which leaves little room for discretionary spending to launch new projects--especially on the part of CNRS, whose projected budgetary needs for 1995 (Fr298 million) are 29 percent greater than for 1992 (Fr231 million). Though outlays by the individual institutions were not itemized, simultaneous financing of all projects currently on the drawing boards at CNRS and CEA (GANIL-Plus, the 15-GeV [billion electron volts] European electron accelerator), Orpheus-Plus, the SOLEIL synchrotron radiation source, [particle] detectors for the LHC, etc.) seems out of reach, even if the Saturne project is discontinued. Choices must be made. Long-term Trends (Nonspace) If one calculates the growth of nonpersonnel expenditures, excluding outlays entailed by the space programs of CNES and CEA, the diminution of real spending for the TGEs, first seen in 1992, continues in 1993 as shown in the following table: Table 1: Nonpersonnel Outlays for Non-Space-Related TGEs (millions of French francs) Year 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Total 1,082 1,085 1,127 1,187 1,192 1,197 1,290 1,289 1,226 Current francs 1993 francs Total 1,266 1,221 1,226 1,254 1,225 1,197 1,290 1,289 1,226 Constant 1993 francs In current francs, five-year growth from 1988 to 1992 is only 10.2 percent, or two percent per year on average, significantly less than inflation, as shown in the second line of Table 1. The spending level for 1993 will be very close to the 1992 level, i.e. no increase. Projections for 1994 offer the hope of some renewed growth in allocations for non-space-related TGEs, principally as a result of an expanded VIRGO program. The stagnation of (non-space-related) TGE spending seen in the last few years is due to several factors: - the commitment of certain agencies such as CNRS [National Scientific Research Center] to rein in growth of TGEs and wait several years before launching new projects; - limitations--indeed, reductions in the case of the CEA--in the financial resources at the disposal of the various institutions; - the small number of new projects that have come to full maturity in the last few years; - the large share of new research funds earmarked for space programs. As in reports for previous years, it is interesting to note (Table 2) the changing ratio of nonpersonnel TGE-related spending to total research ministry program authorizations in the budget bill for CNRS and CEA, two agencies heavily involved with TGEs. Table 2: Nonpersonnel TGE Outlays and Total Program Authorizations for CNRS and CEA (millions of French francs) Year 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 CNRS TGE 177 217 247 251 231 263 Outlays Program 2,208 2,320 2,437 2,476 2,652 2,768 Authorization 8.0% 9.3% 10.1% 10.1% 8.7% 9.5% CEA TGE 289 337 338 360 266 285 Outlays Program 1,360 1,362 1,212 1,142 974 1,040 Authorization 21.2% 24.7% 27.91% 31.5% 27.0% 27.0% [Text] The previous relative growth in the percentage earmarked for TGE-related expenses has stopped in both agencies: - in CNRS, TGE spending has been virtually constant since 1990, and its share of total program authorizations has declined slightly; - in CEA, 1992 was marked by a sharp reduction both in program authorizations and in TGE-related expenditures. Although the ratio does not change for 1993, the figures in both categories are somewhat higher. Long-term Trends (Space) Table 3: Long-term Outlays for CNES and CEA Space Programs (millions of French francs) Year 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Total 732 899 856 814 958 1,131 1,153 1,166 1,057 Current francs 1993 francs Table 3 shows that between 1988 and 1993, TGE-related spending in the space domain enjoyed substantial growth (close to 11 percent per year on average, though with pronounced fluctuations). This growth corresponded to a clearly declared budget priority. However, augmentations in actual outlays were not as sharp as the annual CNES [National Space Studies Center] program proposals would have suggested: Significant reprogramming was necessary, in particular for Topex-Poseidon and ERS-2, as seen in the tables presented in the Council's reports for 1991 and 1992. Projections for the next few years for already-approved projects suggest a certain stagnation in spending. TGE Spending Share To calculate the ratio of investments in scientific TGEs to total spending on civilian research, the ratio between the following two quantities can be evaluated: - total nonpersonnel spending for scientific TGEs; - total sum of program authorizations in the BCRD [Civilian Research and Development Budget] plus ordinary foreign ministry appropriations earmarked for BCRD (these latter principally cover contributions to CERN, ESO, and EMBL [European Molecular Biology Laboratory].

Remarks and Recommendations Project VIRGO In May 1992 the director general of CNRS submitted to the Council the Franco-Italian VIRGO proposal to build a gravity wave detection antenna. VIRGO is an experimental research project in the field of fundamental physics, completely new, and strongly multidisciplinary in terms both of implementation and expected results. The Council first reviewed the proposal in April 1990. At that time, it noted its interest in the scientific objective being pursued and its appreciation of the high quality of the research teams proposing the project. However, it also underlined the need to strengthen those teams, continue with the research and development needed to build the antenna, and provide accurate cost estimates. The Council has been informed of subsequent improvements not only in the project's design but also in its organization and collaborative aspects, and has familiarized itself with the exhaustive cost estimates since provided. In consequence, taking into account the acknowledged value of the scientific objective pursued, the quality of the research teams proposing it, the excellence of their comprehensive description of the project, the solid European cooperation built into it, and the collaborative ties already established with Project LIGO [Laser Interferometer Gravity Wave Observatory], which was launched in 1992, the Council unreservedly recommended that: - this project go forward to the construction phase as quickly as possible, i.e. as soon as permitted by the budgets of the French and Italian agencies providing the financing; - the institutions concerned set up a very clearly articulated structure for the \"project group\" with responsibilities well defined, to assure effective coordination and complementarity of the French and Italian teams working on subsystems of this unique, high-technology antenna; - progress on the project be evaluated periodically by a \"review committee\" composed of experts not associated with the project; - as early as possible the appropriate manufacturers be informed of or involved in development of project components, especially the mirrors. Project SOLEIL As the project now stands, the Council is not in a position to make precise recommendations. The value to the French scientific community of having access to an apparatus like SOLEIL is scarcely in question. We must be assured, however, that a premature positive decision not lead to dispersion of efforts within the French community: It would be a pity not to make maximum use of the ESRF [European Synchrotron Radiation Facility], a high-quality facility in support of which France makes a heavy financial contribution. The very difficult problem that must be faced by institutions involved in the project is that of financing it. Projections of TGE-related appropriations presented in the first part of this report leave no resources available in the short term to finance construction of SOLEIL, absent a sizable augmentation of allocations for the TGEs operated by these agencies. The Council therefore awaits detailed proposals from these institutions. Project LHC (CERN) The Council remains concerned by the large volume of costs that agencies will have to support to ensure suitable participation in construction of the detectors associated with the LHC. It would like to obtain specifics from them concerning how they expect to finance them, as it believes that a large part of this financing will have to come from internal reprogramming, as was already recommended in 1991. The Council will wait to receive all the information which the CERN directorate promised to provide to member-state delegations--in principle before the end of 1993--before rendering an opinion on the project. Part One: Multiyear Program Description TGEs Defined The Council endeavored, in its first meetings in 1988, to clarify the notion of TGEs. These are instruments whose importance for the scientific community and whose cost to build justify a decision-making process concerted at the national level and multiyear financial programming: - Such facilities must be international in their scientific impact, even if managed at the national level. - The research center that develops around the instrument in question must be a hub that attracts a significant portion of the French researchers in the discipline concerned, as well as a number of foreign research teams. - Most TGEs are built in the framework of an international collaborative effort: Even where such a facility is entirely national, it should figure prominently in France's international cooperation policy. - Financially, construction of a TGE necessitates multiyear programming and demands, if not a temporary or permanent increase in the budget of the responsible institution, at least a significant reprogramming of that budget. Given its role as a hub for the discipline concerned, financing is in general provided by all the institutions active in that field. - The minimum consolidated construction cost (including personnel outlays) for a national TGE amounts to several hundred million francs. If the facility is an international one, the French share is on the same order of magnitude, and the total cost of the facility is generally in excess of Fr1 billion. Owing to these criteria there exists, between TGEs and the so-called \"light-heavyweight\" facilities (rarely costing more than Fr10-15 million), a third category of important facilities (\"heavy infrastructure\") which must appear under separate budgetary headings at the agency level but do not require a decision-making process that involves participation of the Council on Large Scientific Facilities. The current list of TGEs in operation or under construction is presented in Annex A2. Tables Explained The research entities involved with TGEs have updated the figures furnished last year, which allows us to compare, in the following tables, actual spending for 1992 (in millions of 1992 francs) versus projected spending for 1993 and subsequent years (in millions of 1993 francs). It is quite evident, especially for the later years, that figures furnished by the institutions are only provisional: They constitute, at the current scientific juncture, the best estimate of needs to come. The final figures may be amended, among other factors, as a result of the need to take new projects or the overall growth in institutional budgets into account. It should also be noted that the budgetary programming presented here covers only those facilities for which a firm go-ahead for construction was given prior to 31 December 1992. Projects on which a Council opinion is still under preparation are presented in the second part of this report. Information furnished by the institutions has been used to prepare two groups of tables: - a breakdown of all facilities by broad scientific discipline (Tables I-1 to I-6); - a comprehensive breakdown by research institution and responsible ministry (Tables II-1 to II-6), which has been placed at the end of this report (Annex A5) to keep down the length of the main text. Annual expenditures for each TGE are presented in three columns: - personnel expenses, covering persons employed at the TGE itself. These outlays can be evaluated very accurately for the national TGEs and for most of the international TGEs. However, the appropriate breakdown between personnel outlays and construction expenses is very difficult to establish for CNES and ESA [European Space Agency] scientific programs, and has not been obtained; - operating expenses, which cover all nonpersonnel expenditures obligated after the TGE went into service. These include both operating costs and new investments to improve or extend the facility's capabilities; - construction expenses, which include all nonpersonnel outlays entailed by construction of a TGE up to the time it goes into service, as well as major remodelings. This classification, which puts the information into the form most useful for the Council, does not necessarily correspond to typical budgetary breakdowns between ordinary expenditures and program authorizations. The reasons for this are explained in Annex A3. Since appropriations for the institutions are granted on an \"all-taxes-included\" basis, the data provided in the tables are quantified in the same way. Because of the special tax status enjoyed by CEA, it is difficult to establish the precise amount of taxes paid by each facility: An average rate of 9.3 percent was added to the HT [taxes not included] data to rationalize comparisons of CEA data for national TGEs with data from other facilities. The data for contributions to international facilities take the varying tax regimes into account. Project Status Reports This section summarizes briefly the most important developments in the TGE sector in 1992; it does not represent a detailed and systematic description of activities in all the TGEs. (1) Elementary Particle Physics Activities of French physicists working in this domain continue to be divided mainly between CERN in Geneva and the DESY [Deutsch Elektron Synchrotron] laboratory in Hamburg, though contact is also maintained with the large international research centers. CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research/European Particle Physics Laboratory: the acronym comes from its original name, European Council on Nuclear Research) has seen the number of its member states grow from 14 in 1990 to 17 as of 1 January 1993 with the entry of Finland, Poland, and Hungary. The Czech and Slovak Republics will be admitted separately in the course of 1993, bringing the number of member states to 19. Scientific activity in 1992, as in the previous year, was focused on exploitation of the LEP [Large Electron-Positron Collider]. Thanks to several important technical advances, beam intensity is expected to exceed specifications in the very near future. As a result, more Z boson decays were observed in 1992 (3 million) than in the three previous years. Very precise tests of the \"standard model\" are carried out with the help of four large detectors whose performance is being steadily improved. The program to augment the beam energy level continues: By the end of 1994, the energy level should be high enough to produce a pair of W bosons (160 GeV); the maximum energy level of 180 GeV should be reached by spring 1995, with installation of 192 superconducting accelerator chambers. The performance of the first chambers delivered by the manufacturers (including one French enterprise) regularly exceeds contractual specifications. Beginning in 1993, 48 LEP chambers will be operational. Finally, work continues apace on preparatory studies for construction of the LHC, both the apparatus itself and the detectors. This subject will be discussed in greater detail in the second part of the present report. The annual budget of CERN's basic program for 1993 totals 951 million Swiss francs; growth from 1992 is less than inflation. A further reduction of about 2.5 percent is planned for 1994, Germany having been exempted from contributing the full amount of its quota until 1995. The French contribution for 1993, representing 16.6 percent of the combined normal contributions of the 14 \"original\" member states, comes to 153.3 million Swiss francs (down 2 million Swiss francs from 1992), or about Fr567 million (one Swiss franc = Fr3.7, as of 1 February 1992). France in 1992 was able to make a voluntary contribution of 10 million Swiss francs, thanks mainly to fluctuations in the exchange rate, to help resolve the dispute with the Eurolep consortium. As in previous years, we must add to the contribution the sum of about Fr50 million for repayment of taxes on the income of French international employees residing in France. Thus total appropriations to CERN in 1993 will amount to about Fr617 million. The breakdown shown in Table I-1 (particle physics, nuclear physics, fusion) is calculated by applying to our contribution the overall relative proportions of the three expense categories in the CERN budget. The only expenditures listed in the \"construction\" category are those associated with the LEP (final instalment to pay off debts incurred for Phase I in 1992 and completion of Phase II) or programmed for construction of the LHC if approved at the end of 1993. The figures corresponding to the years 1995 and 1996 all concern the LHC: In case the decision is postponed, they would of course be revised. As will be recalled, the HERA (Hadron Elektron Ring Accelerator) electron-proton collider went into service in Hamburg in June 1992. A large team of French physicists (IN2P3 and CEA) made a major contribution to realization of the \"H1\" detector and is now analyzing initial data. The DESY laboratory is a German facility financed by BMFT [Federal Ministry for Research and Technology] and the city of Hamburg. France between 1987 and 1989 made in-kind contributions (superconducting magnets) worth about Fr100 million toward HERA's construction. [table omitted] (2) Nuclear Physics French nuclear physicists have at their disposal two large national installations (broadly open to international cooperation): GANIL at Caen, and the Saturne National Laboratory at Saclay. Operating and capital expenses for the two facilities are divided equally between CEA and CNRS/IN2P3. a) GANIL (Large National Heavy Ion Accelerator) is a three-cyclotron unit, in service since 1984 and currently one of the best installations in the world in its field, which is acceleration of heavy ions over a vast range of masses and energies, on the order of several tens of millions of electron volts per nucleon. Research there focuses primarily on exotic nuclei and general properties of nuclear matter. Nonpersonnel operating expenses planned for 1993 amount to Fr52 million. These figures do not take into account appropriations earmarked expressly for laboratory operation. Companion appropriations for outside research teams for experiment preparation are listed and discussed in the third part of this report. GANIL's budget for 1993 should be sufficient to allow it to return to a normal operating schedule (37 weeks) instead of the 33-week schedule funded in the 1992 budget. Future prospects for GANIL, apart from obtaining very high-intensity beams, depend on installation of radioactive beams, which will open up a new line of research in nuclear structure. A final proposal will be presented in 1993: If approved, the financing required beginning in 1994 would amount to about Fr12 million (all taxes included) per year for each of the three partners (CEA, IN2P3, and the Basse-Normandie region). b) The Saturne accelerator, rebuilt between 1974 and 1978 as an \"intermediate\" energy accelerator dedicated to nuclear physics and enhanced in 1987 by a new injector (MIMAS), accelerates protons up to 3 GeV and \"light\" heavy ions up to 1.2 GeV per nucleon. It is the world's best generator of polarized protons and deuterons. It is used to study the internal structure of nuclei and nucleons with the help of the \"hadron detector,\" which offers the advantage of high effective sections but has the disadvantage of complex interaction with the object being studied. Except in the domain of polarized light ion beams, Saturne's capabilities are now exceeded by those of the SIS [strategic information system] synchrotron at Darmstadt. For 1993, its operating budget is Fr38 million, divided equally between CNRS and CEA. This is enough to support 5,000 hours of operation (versus 4,500 hours in 1992), while maintaining accelerator and experimental equipment operations. Beyond 1995, the future of LNS [Saturne National Laboratory] is uncertain and depends on decisions made on other projects. CEA is not programming any funds for it beyond that date. It should be noted that the personnel costs borne by CEA (Fr60 million in 1993, versus Fr14 million for IN2P3) are particularly high: The equipment is operated primarily by CEA personnel, but most users are employed by IN2P3 or foreign laboratories. In its resource program for the next few years, CEA notes that it plans to end its contributions to Saturne's operating budget. In the domain of intermediate-energy nuclear physics, priority for utilization of the flux magnetometer in conjunction with a 15 GeV continuous-beam electron accelerator was announced in the report which the Research Ministry requested from the Academy of Sciences in 1989 (\"La physique nucleaire fondamentale,\" G. Charpak et al., November 1989); this priority was reaffirmed by French physicists in a report requested for the scientific council of IN2P3 and DSM/CEA [Sciences and Materials Directorate, Atomic Energy Commission] and published in 1992 (\"Du nucleaire a la matiere nucleaire: rapport sur la physique aux energies intermediaires,\" B. Desplanques et al., January 1992). Under CEA's MACSE [Accelerator Module with Superconducting Electron Chambers] program, it has been possible successfully to test models of superconducting chambers for this project, studies for which continue in the framework of NUPECC [Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee], now under the aegis of the European Science Foundation. A draft proposal is expected to be presented in 1993. The Council established guidelines on this subject in its 1991 report and is waiting for submission of more advanced proposals. (3) Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion European research in this domain is closely coordinated at the level of the European Communities Commission, under the aegis of the EURATOM [European Atomic Energy Community] Treaty. The fusion program is one of the major elements in the Framework Program for Research and Technology Development [PCRD]. a) The European JET (Joint European Torus) Tokamak located at Culham, near Oxford in Great Britain, is the European Community's most advanced torus and is utilized in collaboration with Sweden and Switzerland. The decision to build it was made in 1978, and JET first produced plasma in 1983. JET's objectives are to define the parameters and operating conditions of a tokamak fusion reactor. The capabilities of JET make it far and away the world leader. Achieving ignition of the plasma will require the \"fusion product\" (density of plasma x energy containment time x temperature) to be further increased by a factor of 5. While performance may have been satisfactory in terms of heating and plasma containment, the impurity ratio is posing problems as more and more energy is injected into the plasma. It was primarily in order to deal with this problem that the research council in October 1991 agreed to extend the life of the JET program to the end of 1996. A preliminary experiment using a weak tritium concentration was carried out in November 1991, producing two megawatts of fusion power. The experiment yielded valuable information about the behavior of tritium in tokamaks. The JET was shut down in February 1992 for a period scheduled to last about 18 months (to October 1993), during which time the \"divertor coils\" needed to fix the impurities problem will be installed. A great deal of new equipment will also be installed to prepare for the final phase of tritium operations in 1995 and 1996. Eighty percent of JET's funding comes from the EEC, 10 percent from the host country, and the other 10 percent from the respective partners in the fusion program. France's direct share (Fr16 million in 1993), paid by CEA, represents 2.5 percent of JET's total budget, which for 1993 comes to 105 million ECU. b) France's Super Torus, located in Cadarache and operated by CEA, will get back on a normal budgetary footing this year (the operating budget increases from Fr52 million in 1992 to Fr70 million in 1993, all taxes included). The program is oriented toward sustained output, a major objective of the international program. It should be noted that in June 1992 an output of 1 mega-ampere [MA] was sustained for a full minute. All basic diagnostics are operational. Research efforts are focused on obtaining quasi-stationary output by adjusting heat levels and mastering techniques for adjusting active and passive components of the primary confining field. This equipment needs further development, to furnish data usable for Project ITER [International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]. In the final phase of experimentation, it might be able to produce output lasting as long as 1,000 seconds, comparable to ITER's performance projections. The preparation of \"Next Step,\" i.e. the next-generation apparatus with which the successor program to JET will work, is becoming an important component of the European program. The detailed planning phase (\"Engineering Design Activities\"--EDA) of Project ITER, which was described in the Council's 1991 report, has become a reality. A general accord and an initial protocol between the four global partners--Europe, the United States, Japan, and Russia--were signed in July 1992. This phase, which will last six years, should lead to a proposed apparatus demonstrating the possibility of self-sustained plasma combustion lasting on the order of 1,000 seconds. Its technical objectives are in process of being determined. The project leader is a Frenchman, and the work will be carried out at three sites (Garching, San Diego, and Naka). The cost of the EDA phase is projected to be about a billion dollars. It probably will entail an augmentation of fusion program appropriations in the course of the fourth PCRD, even before construction of the apparatus, which will require substantially greater investments in the fusion program. In the very short term, financing for the fusion program as a whole will be difficult in 1994, owing to extreme budgetary stringencies affecting the third PCRD. [table omitted] (4) Ground-based astronomy a) The European Southern Observatory (ESO) is the European research umbrella for ground-based astronomy. Its charter is modeled on that of CERN. ESO today has eight member states. The organization gives European astronomers access to a large, modern observatory located at La Silla, in Chile. Its major project, approved in late 1987, is construction of the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which by the end of the century will be the most powerful telescope in the world. ESO's total budget for 1992 was 113 million German marks [DM] (Fr385 million), of which close to DM46 million represents investment in the VLT. Personnel expenditures are 32 percent of the budget. France is providing 24.7 percent of the funds (its contribution will grow from Fr95 million in 1992 to Fr97 million in 1993). The VLT is a cluster of four telescopes, each equipped with an 8-meter-diameter mirror. Fabrication of these mirrors is a technological challenge in itself, since the primary mirrors will be shaped like thin menisci whose shape must be continuously adjusted using active optical technology. The VLT will be installed at Paranal, 500 km north of La Silla, site of the current ESO telescopes. The infrastructural work begun in 1991 will continue, in particular evaluation of seismic risks and a study of near-surface geological strata. Contracts for providing the foundations (Schott) and smoothing the mirrors (Reosc) are proceeding as planned. CNRS's National Institute of Physical Sciences (INSU) is preparing the French astronomical community for the arrival of this very large facility. In accordance with ESO's policy, VLT's focusing apparatus will be fabricated at laboratories of member countries. French teams are involved in two of the instrumentation projects: - development of a multi-object fiber spectrograph, Fuegos (French-Swiss-Italian consortium under the direction of the Paris observatory); - development of a spectroscopic imaging instrument for the 10-micron window (Franco-Dutch consortium under the direction of the DSM/CEA astrophysics service in Saclay). Also, special efforts are being made in the field of optic interferometry. Contracts have been signed with ESO to develop (in France) improvements in the interferometric instrumentation: development and fabrication of very small deformable mirrors (Marseille observatory), and development of a system of [interference] fringe monitoring. A convention was signed in December 1992 between ESO, the Max Planck Gesellschaft (MPG), and INSU for amplification of VLT's interferometric mode: The idea is to supplement the ESO proposal for two auxiliary telescopes 2 meters in diameter (VISA/VLTI [VLT Interferometric Sub Array]) with a third telescope and a delay line, which will greatly strengthen its imaging capabilities. Over a three-year period beginning in 1993, France will contribute Fr17 million to this improvement. b) The Canada-France-Hawaii telescope (CFH) is financed by equal lump-sum contributions from the University of Hawaii, the Canadian National Research Council, and INSU. These institutions are also sharing equally in financing of the 1991-1993 instrumentation plan. Out of the Fr16 million that CNRS is contributing in 1993, Fr10 million corresponds to personnel expenses; there is also Fr4 million to defray travel costs for users. c) The Institute of Millimeter Radioastronomy (IRAM) received new support with the adhesion of the National Geographic Institute of Spain, which reduces CNRS's participation to 47 percent. The growth in activities, now that antennas are fully operational and Spain is involved, explains the programmed budgetary growth. Out of the Fr33 million authorized for 1993, about Fr19 million is to meet personnel costs. In 1994 and 1995 financing will be required for additional equipment on the Bure plateau to support Very Large Base Interferometry (VLBI), a project approved in December 1988; the project will be funded by INSU (since MPG financed the VLBI in Spain). The proposal to add two antennas to the interferometry infrastructure on the Bure plateau will be deferred, as MPG has no plans to finance it in the short term. MPG and CNRS will review project development in June 1993, and a decision may be made in December 1993. CNRS's decision will be closely tied to the program to restructure French ground-based observation facilities. (5) Space-based Astronomy The satellite and space probe programs of which French physicists have been beneficiaries have been carried out by CNES in collaboration with the European Space Agency, Russia, and the United States. CEA contributes to fabrication of some of the instrumentation. a) The Hipparcos astrometry satellite launched in 1989 is still carrying out its original mission despite a very eccentric orbit, the result of problems during launch. High-level ESA teams have made substantial efforts to save the mission. In particular, ESA is financing four receiving stations at diverse longitudes (instead of a single station if the orbit were geostationary). The satellite's power supply should enable it to remain operational until mid-1994. The precision required for the five astronometric parameters (2 milliseconds of arc) very probably will be obtained. Operating allocations (Fr3 million in 1993) are henceforth set aside for support of the French research teams involved. b) The ISO satellite is part of ESA's scientific program. Launch date has been postponed from 1994 to 1995 because of snags in development. Four focal instruments will be launched. France, playing an important role in the consortium, is responsible for the ISOCAM camera; CEA is project leader. In the framework of another European consortium, France is participating in the large wavelength spectrometer. Nonpersonnel outlays programmed by CNES for 1993 amount to Fr55 million. Another Fr1 million is being provided from the CEA budget. c) The first \"cornerstone\" of ESA's Horizon 2000 program includes: - the SOHO [Solar and Heliospheric Observatory] observatory, whose purpose is to study the internal structure of the corona and solar winds, scheduled for launch by NASA in 1995; - the \"CLUSTER\" mission to study small-scale fluctuations in the magnetosphere with the help of four identical satellites positioned at key locations, also scheduled for launch in 1995 or 1996, aboard one of Ariane 5's qualification flights. French laboratories are closely involved, since France is project leader for six of the observation instruments, and CRPE [Center for Physical and Environmental Research] is responsible for important coordination functions at the European level. Development costs to CNES in 1993 come to Fr214 million, and CEA is contributing an additional Fr1 million. d) The second \"cornerstone\" of ESA's Horizon 2000 program is the XMM observatory. Its cost, apart from the apparatus itself, is estimated at 531 million 1991 ECU. The industrial construction phase is expected to get under way by the end of 1993, with launch scheduled for 1999. The basic objective of the XMM mission is the study of soft and medium-strength x-ray radiation (wavelengths between 1 and 50 Angstroms) emitted by gases at very high temperatures (tens of millions of degrees) as a result of supernova explosions. Spatial imaging resolution is better than 0.5 minutes of arc. Spectral resolution is \"medium.\" The feasibility of the mirrors, which it was hoped could be molded onto a structure made of composite materials, has not been fully established: A more traditional but less lightweight solution based on nickel shells is being studied concurrently. Instrumentation consists of three cameras, two spectrometers, and one optical monitor. French participation, which concerns the cameras on the principal focal plane, is in the framework of a consortium of European laboratories; three French space science laboratories are involved very closely with this project. The French share of the construction budget for this newly embraced TGE is Fr15 million in 1993. It will increase incrementally to Fr169 million in 1996. e) France's SIGMA on-board telescope, whose mission is to provide high-resolution spectral and angular imagery of the sky in the low-energy gamma-ray band, has been in operation since December 1989 on board the Soviet satellite \"Granat.\" Given the importance of the results obtained, especially in the region of the galactic center, it was decided to continue operating this instrument for as long as possible. Since 1992, operating costs have been shared with Russia. CNRS will contribute Fr4 million in 1993 to defray nonpersonnel expenses, and CEA will contribute Fr1 million. (6) Planetology a) The 1994-1996 Mars mission in cooperation with Russia is the first phase of exploration of the planet Mars, which will continue in a series of launches between now and the year 2000. The 1994 Mars probe will orbit the planet and leave small stations and penetrators. In 1996, a balloon and small vehicle will be dropped onto the planet's surface. CNES's share of the program this year will be Fr82 million. b) The Cassini-Huygens mission is being developed for exploration of the planet Mars and its satellite Titan. It will be a joint Franco-American project. An orbital module (NASA) will be put into orbit around Saturn, while a descent module (ESA) will be dropped into the atmosphere of Titan. The mission is scheduled for launch by NASA in 1996. CNES will spend Fr74 million on development in 1993, and CEA Fr3 million. Funding for these two projects does not increase in 1993. (7) Oceanology a) - The oceanological fleet TGE consists of the sea-going oceanographic vessels and their on-board equipment; the vessel most recently launched is the \"Atlante,\" which went into service in 1991 equipped with an EM 12 multibeam depth sounder. One facet of the fleet renewal program, funding of the future High-Seas Research Vessel (NRH) at a total estimated cost of Fr160 million, is divided over the 3-year period 1992-1994. In 1993, Fr7 million is earmarked for repairs to the \"Noroit\" in addition to its quadrennial overhaul. In 1995, Fr10 million will be allocated for repairs to the \"Suroit.\" For 1995-1996, consideration is being given to program authorizations for Project Nereis, a light drilling vessel (Fr50 million in 1995, Fr60 million in 1996). Appropriations for each fiscal period correspond to needed renovations or equipment maintenance. In 1993, the oceanological fleet is allocated Fr158 million for operations. This endowment, insufficient to ensure optimal operating conditions, will increase in stages to Fr170 million in 1996. Most of the funds are earmarked for GENAVIR, (a subsidiary of IFREMER [French Research Institute for Exploration of the Sea]), and are used to defray salary costs. The equipment budget will increase from Fr60 million in 1993 to Fr70 million in 1996. Expenses for IFREMER personnel serving on the oceanological fleet amount to about Fr3.2 million per year. [table omitted] b) - Construction of the Marion Dufresne 2 (MD2), the new polar research vessel provisionally approved by the Council in February 1992, has now received the official nod. An economic interest group [GIE] to be composed of General Maritime Company (CGM) and the Polar Institute is now being formed. A contract has been signed between CGM, acting on behalf of the future GIE, and the shipbuilding yards at Havre, subject to final approval of a financial package. Total cost of the operation is Fr556 million, of which Fr50 million is for scientific equipment and technical gear (cranes, winches, etc.) A project group is being established. The MD2 will embody important improvements over MD1, including: - better accommodations for scientific personnel, in terms of both living quarters and working conditions (laboratories, analytical instruments, computers); - a more flexible propulsion system and better navigational equipment; - installation of a multibeam depth sounder. The possibility of returning only once each year to Marseille is being studied in conjunction with the Polar Institute; this would increase the length of the annual oceanographic season and perhaps extend the vessel's operating radius to take in all of the Indian Ocean, to facilitate participation in various international cooperation programs (Indonesia, Australia, etc.). The recommendation of the Council on Very Large Facilities concerning \"ice\" rating was not followed. Implementing it would have been too costly. On the other hand, beginning this year, one-time funding requests are subject to the same scientific evaluation as other oceanographic projects. The budget for the Polar Institute's fleet remains stable in 1993 at Fr24 million. c) The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) was initiated in 1968 in the United States (Deep Sea Drilling Project). In 1974, France became a partner in the first phase of this project, which concluded in 1983. The project enabled researchers to reconstruct the general history of the geological events over the last 200 million that led to the present configuration of the world's oceans and continents. Since October 1984 (after a year devoted to planning and refitting the vessel), a new ODP program has been established; participating in it with the United States are seven international partners: Canada-Australia (consortium), France, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, a 12-nation European consortium, and Russia. The heart of the program is the drilling vessel \"Joides Resolution.\" Results stemming from the initial objectives have contributed to improving science's understanding of fluid circulation in the lithosphere and demonstrated their role in tectonic phenomena. The program has also contributed to the study of paleo-environments. The French ODP community consists of about 230 researchers, engineers, and landside technicians. France's annual contribution is $2.75 million, or Fr18 million. Expenses for IFREMER personnel are estimated at Fr1.2 million per year, plus a companion appropriation of Fr1 million to aid French teams participating in the project. (8) Earth Observation The Council reiterates that it is absolutely essential to establish some means of coordinating the preparation, operation, and scientific exploitation of the entire array of space-based earth observation programs. Despite the efforts of CNES, which created a committee on earth observation programs, the user communities are still too unstructured. a) The Franco-American Topex-Poseidon satellite launched in August 1992 will complete its radar altimetry measurements of worldwide fluctuations in sea level, pinpointing areas of high and low \"pressure\" produced by oceanic circulation. France will contribute Fr106 million to this project in 1993, the year that analysis of the data gets under way. Discussions with the United States are currently being held to prepare a successor to that apparatus. The structure of the companion appropriations for this TGE is presented in summary form in the third part of this report. b) The WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) program is devoted to the study, over a five-year period (1990-1995), of heat redistribution via oceanic circulation. It includes a program of hydrographic measurement and tracers that will cover all the oceans, laying of surface and subsurface floats, networks of current-measuring anchorages, and intensive utilization of altimetry data. In all, worldwide hydrographic survey activity will amount to the equivalent of 25 ship-years. In addition to these observation programs, WOCE has plans to involve itself in the vital domain of simulations and data analysis, which will require substantially augmented data processing facilities. The French part of the WOCE program is concentrated in two regions: the South Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, including its antarctic part. IFREMER is responsible for development the of subsurface floats (over a two to three-year period). In 1992, nonpersonnel expenses amounted to Fr15 million. This level will be maintained in 1993 and 1994 and then diminish. Personnel outlays remain stable at Fr4 million. c) The ENVISAT program adopted at Granada in November 1992 involves a series of satellites dedicated initially to the objectives of research on climate and terrestrial environment, especially radioactivity. It uses a mid-size platform optimized for payloads in the 1.5-ton range. The ENVISAT-1 platform will carry five instruments built by ESA and four financed on a national basis (pursuant to a \"call for proposals\"). The ENVISAT-1 program will get under way in January 1993, looking toward a launch date in 1998 with an expected five-year orbital life. The budgetary cost to France in 1993 is Fr167 million; the amount will increase each year thereafter, reaching Fr293 million in 1996. d) The ERS (Earth Resource Satellite [or Earth Remote Sensing Satellite]) is an \"optional\" program for ESA. It consists of two satellites: ERS-1 and ERS-2. These satellites (the first was launched in July 1991, the second is to be launched in 1994) will carry out missions in oceanographic meteorology, primarily with the aid of UHF instruments that will permit continuous observation of the ocean surface (temperature, wind, waves) and ice. France's contribution is Fr1,200 million (in 1988 francs) to ERS-1 and Fr800 million (in 1990 francs) to ERS-2. Programmed CNES outlays in 1993 amount to Fr234 million. The ERS satellites will ensure continuous observation over a six-year period; in principle, they will then be replaced by ESA's POEM-1 (Polar Orbit Environment Monitoring) mission about 1998. The Council notes that, as it had predicted, earlier decisions will once again have a very significant impact on spending in 1993. Between 1992 and 1995 there will be a substantial increase in resources allocated to earth observation. (9) Geology and Interior Geophysics The Deep Geology of France (GPF) project has recently completed two drill holes in the Ardeche. In a meeting in November 1992, the scientific council for the program took note of the high quality of the multidisciplinary research conducted during the previous 18 months on materials from the first drill hole. In early 1991, the program steering committee decided to elevate GPF to the status of a European-level program, reinforcing dialogue with the scientific communities of neighboring countries, and in particular strengthening links with the corresponding German program. The first step was to create a new scientific council on which several countries are now represented: Germany, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Switzerland. The TGE Council believes the project has not yet reached a sufficiently mature stage to warrant examination and the rendering of an opinion. (10) Condensed Matter Studies Beginning in 1994, European scientists at Grenoble doing research on condensed matter will have at their disposal a pair of installations unique in the world: the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) and the Laue Langevin Institute (ILL). In addition, the French scientific community has its own national facilities, the LURE at Orsay and the Leon Brillouin Laboratory (LLB) at Saclay. a) Neutron sources The High Flux Reactor (RHF) is operated by the Laue Langevin Institute of Grenoble, a private French enterprise. An intergovernmental convention structures relations between it and its partners, the CEA and CNRS in France, the KFK in Karlsruhe in Germany, and the SERC [Scientific and Engineering Research Council] in the United Kingdom. Through the end of 1993, the annual budget will be funded by approximately equal contributions from the three partners (France's 1993 contribution amounts to Fr134 million, taxes included). The French contribution covers the taxes in their entirety. The RHF is currently idled, following discovery of cracks on the baffle plate of the heavy water circuit. In May 1992, the steering committee decided to completely overhaul the reactor at a cost of Fr173 million; financing was obtained by reprogramming funds within a budget that has remained unchanged (exclusive of taxes) from 1992 to 1993. Plans are to restart the reactor in July 1994. The reactor being almost completely rebuilt, one can expect it to remain in operation for 20 more years without major problems. The English side has given formal notice it plans to withdraw from the international convention, which expires on 31 December 1993. A codicil to the convention was negotiated between the partners and signed in March 1993. It authorizes a reduction in the English contribution. ILL has reorganized and implemented various steps to cut costs: Operations will be limited to five cycles (232 days), with only 25 instruments programmed, compared to six cycles (279 days) and 30 instruments before the shutdown. ILL plans to delegate responsibility for the spectrometers increasingly to research teams, under contracts analogous to those between ESRF and collaborating research groups [CRGs]; it also plans to develop additional scientific partnership conventions like those already in existence with Switzerland, Spain, and Austria. The budget for 1994 is estimated at Fr270 million (1992 francs), with contributions from partners covering only Fr240 million. France's share will be Fr126 million (including Fr10 million in taxes). Beginning in 1995, a Fr6 million reserve will be set aside to cover reprocessing of fuel elements currently in storage. [table omitted] The Orpheus [\"Orphee\"] reactor and the Leon Brillouin Laboratory (LLB), a facility jointly owned by CEA and CNRS, are located at the Saclay research center. For 1993, the budget will be Fr120 million (including Fr68 million for data analysis operations). The reactor started up only about a dozen years ago and remains very modern. But maintenance outlays will have to be budgeted in 1994 and funds set aside, as with the RHF, for fuel reprocessing (Fr9 million in 1993, Fr12 million in 1994). Neutron flux is four times weaker than in the RHF, but the reactor has a collection of features (two cold sources and one radioactive source) that give it useful characteristics. Twenty-one spectrometers are used in experiments. The number of experiment proposals grew considerably in 1992 (from 300 to 500) following shutdown of the RHF and remains at the higher level this year. To accommodate the surge in requests, CEA and CNRS have taken steps (Fri.1 million) to keep the reactor in operation and available for use as much of the time as possible (about 275 days). These measures will be continued in 1993 and 1994. A new type of cold source, ring-shaped, may be installed in the reactor in 1994, to augment the amount of neutron flux available with existing equipment. No decision has been made thus far on proposed augmentation of the reactor's experimental capacities, which in any case cannot be completed without external partners or before the RHF is back in operation. The financing (Fr70 million), stretched over a 3-year period, could begin in 1993 with a Fr2 million allocation for studies. Actual work will be timed to coincide with the reactor's overhaul, which cannot be delayed beyond 1997. French researchers have access to other neutron sources, including the ISIS pulsed source at England's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. The CNRS-CEA-SERC accord on ISIS expired at the end of 1992; since French requests for access to ISIS more or less counterbalanced British requests for access to LLB, CEA and CNRS have proposed continued collaboration with SERC in the form of reciprocal access times at LLB and ISIS. In both cases, experiments are selected from proposals after discussion by a committee of experts. b) Synchrotron radiation sources The principal objective of the private company ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) is to build and operate at Grenoble a synchrotron radiation source and ancillary instrumentation to be used by the scientific communities of contracting countries. The source, a 6 GeV electron-positron storage ring, is already producing hard x-ray beams of very high intensity, six months ahead of schedule. ESRF will contribute to fundamental and applied research on the structure of condensed matter in domains such as physics, chemistry, crystallography, earth sciences, biology and medicine, surface phenomena, and the study of materials. The apparatus is financed by Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Sweden, and Switzerland. Numerous experiment stations (beam lines) are under construction around the periphery of the storage ring. Even before tests of the radiation source have been successfully concluded, initial test experiments have been performed on the three beam lines already installed in the ring experiment building. These experiments confirm source consistency with respect to beam intensity and stability. The floor stability problems noted in the experiment hall do not threaten to derail early completion of the project. Corrective measures are under way. Results of first efforts to fix the problem confirm the repair work has improved plate stability; it remains to be seen whether the improvement is permanent. This is why all lines currently being installed are clustered in the south half of the experiment building, so the floor can be replaced one section at a time, if necessary. For 1993, the objective is to continue intensive testing of the first group of beam lines. A few scientific experiments may be scheduled concurrently. More than 20 experiment proposals have already been submitted. The first such experiments were conducted in December 1992. Scientific exploitation of the facility will begin in 1994 with seven fully tested beam lines (the number should reach 30 by 1998). France's share of the ESRF budget will be Fr156 million in 1993. It will be Fr150 million in 1994, then drop to Fr126 million in 1996. The share devoted to exploitation will increase, going from Fr26 million in 1994 to Fr50 million in 1996. It should be noted that the Convention calls for the portion funded by France to decline from 33 percent during construction period to 27.5 percent after operations get under way. In the framework of CRG contracts with ESRF, France is fitting two beam lines on cambered magnets. This equipment has been financed by the Ministry of Research, the Rhone-Alpes region, and the department of Isere (a total of Fr21 million over the three-year period from 1990 to 1992). An additional Fr6 million from CEA and CNRS is in the pipeline to complete the project. Installation is scheduled for early 1993, with equipment going into service by the end of the year. The Laboratory for Utilization of Electromagnetic Radiation (LURE) will receive a total 1993 endowment of Fr116 million provided by CNRS, CEA, and MEN [Ministry of National Education]. In keeping with the decision of the board of trustees, start-up financing will conclude in 1993. The cost of operating CLIO [Collaboration for an Infrared Laser at Orsay] has been included in the LURE budget. The EEC contract for \"access to large installations,\" of which the laboratory was a beneficiary, expired in 1992. A new request has been prepared. The growth in the number of users of synchrotron radiation and the aging of LURE's existing equipment have prompted consideration of the idea of building a new source that would become operational about the year 2000. The apparatus in question, \"SOLEIL,\" is still on the drawing boards. Scientific justification and technical specifications are under preparation. A preliminary discussion may be found in part two of this report. c) The EURECA [European Retrievable Carrier] space platform is a module launched by an American shuttle with recovery scheduled for several months later. On board are microgravity devices to produce semiconductor and protein crystals, treat alloys, and perform biological experiments. Compared to Spacelab, it has the advantage of being able to conduct longer missions under better microgravity conditions and with reduced safety requirements, but it demands more sophisticated automation of experiments, since there is no possibility of outside assistance. The primary payload consists of five multi-user instruments plus several national experiments (two were developed by French laboratories). EURECA was launched in July 1992, and recovery is scheduled for sometime in the first half of 1993. The cost for CNES is Fr39 million for 1992 and Fr19 million for 1993. No further flights of this platform are currently scheduled. (11) Life Sciences The life sciences community is making increased use of large facilities devoted to the study of condensed matter (synchrotron radiation and neutron diffusion). The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg is a facility that offers European scientists a cluster of high-quality semi-heavy scientific instruments. It also has two branches at ILL in Grenoble and the DESY Laboratory in Hamburg. This laboratory, a 15-nation project, has evolved into one of the best in Europe in the fields of cellular and structural biology. It is particularly active in the domains of cellular biology, differentiation, biological structures and information systems, genetic expression, physical instrumentation, biochemical instrumentation, information processing services, and data banks. It also conducts training for researchers who are completing or have already completed their doctorates. EMBL has plans to expand its Grenoble branch, to take more advantage of the ESRF, and to establish a new branch (European biological information systems), the site for which had not yet been chosen by the time this report was prepared. Contributions by member states in 1993 will amount to DM68 million (up 11 percent from 1991). Personnel expenses account for close to 60 percent of the budget. The French contribution (16.7 percent) will be DM11.5 million, equal to about Fr39 million. Considering the size of the financial investment, the level of participation of French researchers is still too low, and the Council urges that incentives be offered to the French scientific community to promote increased participation by French scientists in the work of EMBL. [table omitted] (12) Interdisciplinary Projects Under this heading are two research programs that involve diverse disciplines. a) Detection of gravity waves (Project VIRGO) This project in fundamental science, under the leadership of CNRS/IN2P3, involves a broad spectrum of physicists and astrophysicists, theoreticians, and experimenters. It was approved by the Council in 1992, and in cooperation with Italy it has now been launched. CNRS is considering committing a Fr40 million program authorization in 1993 to this project, which is described in detail in part two of this report. b) Manned space flights These are experiments carried out with human beings in attendance, under microgravity conditions (10[.sup]-3[/] to 10[.sup]-5[/] g). The primary areas of research involved are: --study of human behavior during manned flight: - understanding the effects of gravity on the process of perception and spatial orientation; - analysis of adaptive responses of major physiological functions to microgravity (cardiovascular and immune systems) --biology: reproductive functions, radiation environment and its effects on living tissue; --physical sciences in general: materials, crystal growth, atomic physics, etc. The latter two research categories do not require the presence of human beings and could be pursued with robotic equipment. CNRS in 1993 will spend Fr170 million on all these programs, the cost of which is bound to increase. The manned flight program is an important element of bilateral collaboration programs (United States, Russia) and the ESA program (notably the European contribution to the Freedom space station, which could require sizable investments). The Council does not yet have a clear vision of the level of resources France is prepared to commit under these three categories and questions the scientific priority of these programs. (13) Technical/operational Facilities Outlays programmed under this heading are noted here only for purposes of information, and only for those international facilities that deserve the appellation \"very large facility.\" Programming decisions concerning them fall outside the competence of the TGE Council. a) Construction of the European Transonic Wind Tunnel (ETW) at Porz (Germany) continued in 1992, remaining on schedule. The goal of completing the mechanical engineering was met. The calibration and testing phase is next. Inauguration of the facility is set for June 1993. Projections of total cost remain under the budget ceilings set by the governments of the four participating countries (France, Germany, Great Britain, Netherlands). France's 28-percent share of costs in the construction phase (which ends in 1994) will translate in 1993 into a Fr37 million contribution from the Ministry of Transport (and an equal amount from the Ministry of Defense). b) The METEOSAT network of meteorological satellites in geostationary orbit was developed under the overall lead of the European Space Agency and is exploited by the meteorological organization EUMETSAT [European Meteorological Satellite Organization]. France's share in 1992 was financed with a Fr139 million contribution from the Ministry of Transport (national meteorological directorate). This subsidy is listed in the BCRD under technical programs. The corresponding amount for 1993 will be Fr197 million. Data collected by these satellites is used primarily by the meteorological forecasting services. It is also used in research on climatic change, especially research on cloud cover. [table omitted] The operational character of the METEOSAT satellite network prompted EUMETSAT to reposition one of its satellites to compensate for the delay in stationing of an American satellite, thus to ensure coverage of the Atlantic zone for the United States. One of the tangible benefits from this action was the detection of Hurricane Andrew last August and issuance of an alert a week before its passage over Florida. The expected increase in appropriations between 1993 and 1996 will be sufficient to keep the existing system operational until about the year 2000 (construction of two additional satellites and one launch), to begin building the new-generation satellites that will replace them, and finally to fund European participation (per international agreements) in observations from polar orbit, which today only the United States can conduct. The budget augmentation is less than projected initially. In fact, from a technical standpoint the METEOSAT satellite system is doing so well that the launch date for the next satellites could slip without jeopardizing continuity of EUMETSAT operations; having loaned METEOSAT-3 to the United States to cover for the delay in orbiting GOES-Next, we can expect the favor to be reciprocated at some point, should the METEOSAT system run into problems. France therefore has persuaded EUMETSAT to stretch out financing of the project. Commentary on Future Needs The elements appearing in Tables I-1 to I-6, in particular I-6, \"Summary by Disciplines,\" prompt the Council to make the following observations: - In elementary particle physics, the future of the discipline depends on whether it is decided to build the LHC at CERN: The Organization by the end of 1993 must furnish the information needed to make a final decision, but already it appears that building the detectors is likely to pose difficult problems at the level of national agencies and institutions. - The Council has noted CEA's intention to cease operating the Saturne accelerator in 1996 in order to move ahead along new lines of research using the GANIL beginning in 1994 (radioactive ion beams). This change of direction has not been expressly confirmed by CNRS, which exploits the equipment on a shared basis with CEA. The Council still hopes to see an international project elaborated to build a 15-GeV continuous-beam electron accelerator. - In the domain of controlled nuclear fusion, it is noted that the budget for Tore-Supra [Super Torus] is returning to normal levels, after a temporary dip in 1992. Also, the Council notes that the detailed planning phase of Project ITER is now under way. To the extent that this facility would be realized outside Europe, in a global context, the Council is not certain whether it is qualified to render an opinion on that subject. - The Council notes with satisfaction the progress on construction of the VLT, and is pleased that INSU has made available the supplementary funds needed to expand that instrument's interferometric mode. - In the sector of space-based astronomy, the Council notes the delay in construction of the ISO satellite. It also points out that it was not consulted before approval of the XMM mission. - In oceanology, construction of the two vessels recently approved by the Council (the NRH and the Marion Dufresne 2) is proceeding as planned. - In the domain of earth observation, the sizable augmentation in financial requirements already foreseen last year has been confirmed (up Fr155 million). It is bound to continue, given the higher funding levels that will be required for ENVISAT-1: Fr90 million more in 1995 than in 1993. Like the XMM, this environmental study mission, adopted at the Granada conference, was not the subject of consultation with the Council. - Programmed outlays in the condensed matter sector will steadily decline (down Fr85 million) between 1992 and 1996, thanks to completion of the construction phase of ESRF and operational economies at ILL. This could leave room for the possibility of new projects, but reprogramming to other scientific domains (e.g. Project VIRGO) must also be taken into consideration. - The Council is pleased that an accord guaranteeing the long-term future of ILL has been signed with the two partners, English and German, despite the attendant financial restrictions on full exploitation of the facility. - The Council notes with satisfaction the fact that progress on construction of the ESRF continues ahead of schedule, as well as the high quality of the x-ray beaming equipment furnished. - The Council continues to question the pertinence of the expenditures for manned space flights, the scientific utility of which still appears to it unclear. Part Two: Progress on Projects and new Projects Only one TGE proposal advanced sufficiently in 1992, in terms of planning within the scientific community, for the Council to take it up to render a definitive opinion: That project (VIRGO) is discussed in this second part of this report, accompanied by the Council's recommendations. In addition, the Council received updates on the status of progress in the SOLEIL synchrotron radiation accelerator project and the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN. The status of these two projects and the Council's preliminary recommendations are also presented in this second part of the report. As previously noted, in rendering its opinions the Council decided to put most emphasis on the following points: - the scientific value of the project and its impact on the discipline concerned; - the size of the community of potential users and the structuring role of the facility for that community; - the role of the facility at the international level, and analysis of the cooperation expected; - construction and exploitation costs, attendant laboratory costs, personnel needs, and ramifications for institutional and agency budgets. These conditions have already been formulated explicitly in the previous reports. Project VIRGO The Council in May 1992 formally took up the Franco-Italian gravity wave detection proposal (VIRGO) submitted by the director general of CNRS. The Council had examined the project previously, in April 1990. At that time it indicated its interest in the scientific objective pursued and noted the high technical caliber and overall quality of the scientific teams proposing it; it underlined the necessity for further strengthening these teams and continuing with the research and development needed for fabrication of the antenna and precise evaluation of costs. The analysis, presented in the 1991 report, is updated in what follows. Scientific program: Modern theories of gravitation predict that a group of accelerated masses can engender gravitational radiation. General relativity, the best known and most accepted of these theories, allows of precise predictions of the properties and intensity of this radiation. Close study of pulsar PSR 1913 + 16 has established that the slowdown of the binary system to which this pulsar belongs is fully consistent with the hypothesis of the emission of gravity waves. Their direct observation would be still more convincing. Even more importantly, such detection would have the long-term consequence of giving birth to a new mode of observation in astrophysics. The physical observation being sought is an infinitesimal variation in the distance between two mass points during the passage of a gravity wave. The only detectable signals--and they are very weak--come from condensed astrophysical objects. The collapse of the core of a supernova situated in our galaxy will generate a brief signal (1 millisecond), one of the most intense imaginable, but this type of event is rather infrequent. It is thus necessary to be able to detect more distant supernovas. Consequently we must aim for a relative sensitivity of 10[.sup]-21[/] to 10[.sup]-22[/] (approximately the ratio between the radius of an atom and the distance between the earth and the sun). Such sensitivity would also make possible the observation of other sources whose existence is all but certain. In short, this is an experiment in fundamental physics which requires recourse to highly multidisciplinary technologies, and whose impact on astrophysics, albeit long-term, could be essential. Technical characteristics of the project: The development of laser metrology opens up the possibility today of interferometric detection of gravity waves thanks to increased sensitivity over a wide band of frequencies. This approach is much more promising than those hitherto explored. The interferometry projected for VIRGO has the structure of a Michaelson [interferometer], i.e. a separating plate that splits the laser beam into two waves propagating along two perpendicular arms. The passage of a gravity wave train induces differential deformation of the two arms, producing a phase displacement of the partial wave, thus a change in observed luminosity. The optimal signal level (differential phase displacement of the two arms) is reached when the optical length L of each arm is equivalent to one-fourth the length of the gravity wave. For a band of frequencies below the kilohertz [kHz], this yields optical paths greater than 75 km in length. Inasmuch as such a length is not practically attainable, the arms of the interferometric apparatus, 3 km long, form a Fabry-Perot [resonating] chamber with a grid fineness rating of 50. Despite this optimization, the effect to be measured is still infinitesimal (10[.sup]-16[/] m). Preparations for VIRGO were responsible for several complex technical advances: computer-programmed simulations of the precise characteristics of optical components, vibration isolation, high vacuum in a large container, and an extremely stable single-mode Neodymium/YAG laser. It is important to note that indisputable proof of the existence of gravity waves can only be obtained by simultaneous detection of these waves by two independent detection devices, to be certain of eliminating ground noise mimicking the signal being investigated. Structure of the project: New researchers, engineers, and technicians became involved in the project in 1991. About 90 people are currently participating in it. Project teams have made considerable progress in defining and testing all components of the antenna with the exception of mirrors. As early as 1991, the scientific value of the project was accepted unreservedly by scientific experts independent of the project. The reliability of the technology, the modalities, and the cost of building the antenna were set forth in February 1992 in the \"Final Conceptual Design\" (FCD) prepared by the Italian and French promoters. At the request of INFN [Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics] and CNRS, experts reviewed it in April 1992. The experts have submitted a very favorable recommendation, which was taken into consideration along with subsequent comments from the scientists concerned. Investment and timetable: This favorable evaluation led CNRS to request a formal opinion from the Council, with a view to giving top priority in the TGE program to finance this project. The antenna would be installed at Cascina, near Pisa. Construction would last six years and cost 81 million ECU in 1992 currency (about Fr540 million), to be divided between INFN (55 percent) and CNRS (45 percent). Personnel needs have been estimated at about 500 man-years. Most personnel will be researchers, engineers, or technicians belonging to INFN or CNRS; their salaries are not included in the above figures. International context: Detection of gravity waves is the subject of research in all major countries, but especially the United States and Europe. Project VIRGO today is collaborating closely with America's counterpart Project LIGO and receives scientific and technical support from English and German researchers. After Britain's SERC backed off from a joint project with Germany's MPG, that project was shelved. But European efforts to build at least one antenna in Europe are being more closely coordinated. A tripartite ad hoc committee--called for in an April 1992 declaration of common interest signed by CNRS, INFN, and MPG--met in Geneva in May of that year. It recommended that German, British, French, and Italian physicists and engineers expand technical collaboration and coordinate their research and development efforts. Representatives of MPG confirmed their interest, though the latter is not currently in a position to participate in financing. Collaboration with the American Project LIGO (which calls for two antennas in the United States) has been expanded, with a view to correlating future American and European observational data. In comparing the two projects, the Council made the following comments: - In its initial version, VIRGO will be able to make finer measurements: The American antennas will be much less sensitive below 50 Hz and about equal between 100 and 10,000 Hz; - there are significant design differences between VIRGO and LIGO, a fact which will reinforce the credibility of signals detected by all the antennas; - assuming the existence of two American antennas with sensitivity equal to VIRGO, the latter's presence would significantly augment the probability of detecting a signal; - the two LIGO antennas will not be built simultaneously: NSF [National Science Foundation] estimates that the second will be completed a little less than two years after the first, and VIRGO would be completed before the second American antenna. In consequence, given the acknowledged value of the scientific objective pursued, the quality of the proposing research teams, the excellence of their comprehensive description of the project, the solid European cooperation embedded in it, and the collaboration already established with Project LIGO (which was launched in 1992), the Council recommends unreservedly that: - this project proceed to the construction phase as early as possible, i.e. as soon as research budgets permit; - the agencies and institutions put in place a very well articulated structure for the project group, with responsibilities well defined, to assure strong coordination and complementarity of French and Italian teams working on subsystems of the novel and highly technical antenna; - progress on the project be reviewed at regular intervals by a review committee composed of experts not involved in the project; - as early as possible the appropriate manufacturers be informed of or involved in development of project components, especially the mirrors. The CNRS's council on large instruments has also endorsed Project VIRGO. But the construction schedule and corresponding program authorizations have been altered to take into account what CNRS can contribute (Fr40 million for construction) and to smooth out the 1994 spending surge entailed by the optimal timetable proposed in the FCD. This means about six months' slippage in completion of the project. The Italian partner, INFN, has accorded it top priority among its special projects for the next five-year plan, which is to be negotiated during the first half of 1993. Project SOLEIL The Council has already mentioned, in its 1992 report, the deliberations of the Prospects Committee established in 1990 by CNRS, CEA, and the Ministry of National Education to evaluate the synchrotron radiation needs of the French scientific community. The institutions' request was motivated by problems of aging of some equipment at the LURE laboratory, in particular the linear injection accelerator and the DCI ring [Igloo Collision Device]. In the document that it prepared (\"Rapport du Comite de Prospective pour l'utilisation du rayonnement synchrotron en France,\" H. Benoit et al., July 1991), the Prospects Committee categorically recommended construction of a new storage ring to complement the ESRF (which operates in the hard x-ray range). This new ring would enable France to hold onto its position in the far ultraviolet to soft x-ray range despite scheduled decommissioning of LURE's installations. The ring, with an energy level of about 2 GeV, should have the characteristics of so-called \"third-generation\" devices and be able to function either at high intensity or with a low number of packets to permit experiments involving time correlations. In that connection, the LURE scientific community conducted a study of the laboratory's future in the year 2000 and France's synchrotron radiation needs once ESRF becomes operational. The result was a November 1991 draft proposal for \"Optimized Source of Intermediate-Energy Light at LURE\" (SOLEIL). This document gives a brief description of a 2.15 GeV machine, indicates the principal technical variables that dictate the structure of the project, and gives a more exhaustive presentation of scientific arguments in favor of the new equipment. As of early 1993, a fuller technical study is being prepared, with detailed evaluation of the cost of construction for the machine, eventual supporting facilities, and scientific equipment. At the current stage of thinking, the institutions concerned--CNRS, CEA, DRED [Directorate of Research and Doctoral Studies] (Ministry of National Education)--have not yet come to a decision whether to support the project, hence whether to request a formal opinion from the TGE Council. The Council, which has expressed the desire to be kept informed not only of fully matured projects but also of those for which preparatory work is well advanced, asked one of its members (G. Ferey) for a report on the current status of SOLEIL. The report was given at the Council meeting in November 1992. The principal elements of G. Ferey's report, and comments from the Council during the discussion, are summarized below. National and international context a) LURE Laboratory: The current status of the LURE laboratory is described in the \"SOLEIL\" report. The laboratory presently operates three machines: the DCI, the Super-ACO, and the injector that serves both. DCI: Built between 1971 and 1975 for high-energy physics, it was used for that purpose for 9 years but was converted in 1985 into a synchrotron radiation source. The 1.85-GeV energy beam generates photons at energy levels between 3 and 25 keV [kiloelectron volts] on magnetic dipole lines and 3-40 keV on lines from the superconducting wiggler. The machine is notable for the exceptional duration of its powerful beam (55 hours at an intensity of 300 milliamperes [mA]). It is handicapped in some experiments however by the large transverse dimension of the positron packet (hence of the optical source), the lack of sufficient space surrounding the ring, and limitations on the number of insertions (only one in practice). It presently has 22 experiment stations. Start-up funds provided in 1990 should be sufficient to ensure acceptable operations up to the end of the decade. Super-ACO: Built between 1982 and 1987, this ring was the first of the so-called third-generation machines dedicated to synchrotron radiation. The source is small in size, and its cross-sections can accommodate up to six undulators. At present it has 28 experiment stations operated full-time or on a shared basis around the ring. It currently is the best machine in the extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray range. With energy of 800 MeV [megaelectron volts], it permits coverage of the visible band up to 5 keV and will soon operate in the millimetric wavelength range (the SIRLOIN experiment now in the final stages). It is the only machine that makes such massive use of temporal structuring of the beam, which operates 50 percent of the time in a stable two-packet mode, with a 120-nanosecond interval, at a total intensity of 200 mA, while the other half of the time it operates in a 24-packet mode at a total intensity of 400 mA for production of high-flux photons. Injector: This is a linear accelerator with energy of 2.3 GeV which with the help of a converter generates positrons with energy of 1.1 GeV. The choice of positrons is justified by the fact that they make it possible to obtain beams that are more stable and have longer duration than electrons. The oldest part of this apparatus dates from 1957, the most recent from 1968. With this impressive equipment endowment and with what might be called its adolescent years behind it, LURE has grown considerably in recent years. In 1991 it had close to 1,300 users working at some forty experiment stations--a load factor that makes use of almost all possible beam lines. Seventy-five percent of users are French (European demand has been rising steeply over the last two years), and participation is evenly balanced between the Paris region and the provinces; industrial demand (including demand assimilable to industry, such as calibration of on-board satellite instruments for ESA via IAS [Institute of Space Astrophysics], or experiments conducted by CEA's DAM [Directorate of Military Applications]) accounts for about 10 percent of all work sessions. The number of projects submitted and the number of users have more than doubled in the last 6 years. This trend, noted at LURE as well as other centers, shows no sign of leveling off--quite the opposite. LURE's weak points have to do with the age of some of the equipment: The injector is old, too big, and very costly to maintain; the DCI ring, built 20 years ago for elementary particle physics, is no longer competitive with machines being built now. On the other hand, the Super-ACO could continue to play an important role in its domain for many more years if furnished with a modern injector. b) Status of the project vis-a-vis ESRF: ESRF is beginning to get into operation at Grenoble well ahead of schedule, and is already obtaining excellent beam quality. However, several objective considerations argue for giving French researchers access to a complementary machine that operates at lower energy levels: - The ESRF source is unable to cover the ultraviolet to far-ultraviolet to soft x-ray range (photons with energy less than 1 keV, basically the domain of Super-ACO). Also, it is unlikely that the time-structured configuration can be used with the ESRF synchrotron radiation source; - our financial contribution will give French researchers access to about 25 percent of ESRF's operational availability, the equivalent of about ten full-time experiment stations (including time used by collaborating research groups). Access will thus be difficult and competition very tough. Experience in the neutron domain has demonstrated the utility of having, along with ILL, facilities at LLB for purposes of training users, conducting standard analytic tests, preparing original experiments, developing new technologies, and serving the needs of industry. c) Other projects in Europe: Several facilities that are comparable to SOLEIL (energies between 1.3 and 2.5 GeV) and complementary to ESRF are already in operation or under construction in neighboring countries: - In Germany, DORIS III (at Hamburg) will be augmented, per a very recent decision, by the BESSY II in Berlin, a third-generation ring optimized for the ultraviolet-far ultraviolet-soft x-ray range; - In Italy, ELETTRA will enter into service in Trieste in 1994 with a program very comparable to that of SOLEIL; - In the United Kingdom, since 1987, the SRS at Daresbury has been Europe's best source of high-intensity x-rays. A new machine is under study (DAPS [Daresbury Advanced Photon Source]); In Sweden, construction of the MAX II at Lund has been authorized; In Spain, plans are being considered to install a 2.5-GeV synchrotron in Catalonia (Barcelona). Technical characteristics of the project: Project SOLEIL is the result of taking the following factors into consideration: - user requests, described hereinafter; - the experience acquired in developing ACO, DCI, and Super-ACO; - experience at the international level, ESRF in particular. The project starts from the concept of a 2.15-GeV positron storage ring (i.e. with enough energy for the undulator to function properly in the kiloelectron volt range) with about thirty emission points, about one-third of which are multi-user, for a total of about forty experiment stations. The circumference of the ring is close to 200 m. Its energy is comparable to third-generation machines such as ELETTRA and BESSY II. With optimization of parameters, the ring can be very compact and cost-effective. The apparatus supports maximum-flux operation with a total intensity of 300 mA (240 packets) and beam life of 15 to 20 hours, the possibility of operations with one to six packets, and unit intensities of 10 mA for more than 10 hours with excellent emissivity (greater than Super-ACO at 800 MeV, and 10 times greater than DCI). It should be noted, and this is the most novel feature of the project, that the solution adopted meets user needs in terms of both emissivity and beam duration, accommodating both temporal structuring and high flux. Most of the technical decisions have already been made, thanks in part to the experience acquired by LURE itself and to the optimizing solutions adopted by other centers. This is the case in particular for alignment techniques, which will be based on ESRF's experience (alignment by hydraulic level, with lifters capable of effecting displacements on the micrometric scale in a gamut of frequencies ranging from .1 to several dozen Hertz while preserving excellent time precision). Already finalized options concern utilization of positrons (despite its initial cost), sextipoles fully integrated into the quadripoles, generalized utilization of split-pair control of beam elements, the vacuum chamber, injection, photon beam stability, and topography of the building. Two options are still open. They concern radiofrequency acceleration and beam lines, an area where LURE, despite its own experience, is very closely following developments under way at other centers to stabilize photon beams. As for the injector, in light of the experience amassed and the options adopted in numerous other projects, the proposal is leaning toward the idea of a booster synchrotron adjoining the positron source rather than a long linear accelerator. Accordingly, the system will include: - a 200-MeV linear electron accelerator delivering beam pulses of 2 to 5 A [Angstrom units] via an electron-positron converter; - a converter (e[.sup]+[/]/e[.sup]-[/] output =0.02 GeV); - a linear positron accelerator with an energy of 400 MeV; - a booster synchrotron accelerating the positrons at 2.15 GeV before injection into the ring, the two accelerators being built by a company with expertise in the field. With the booster option, and assuming it is built at the Orsay site, the estimated cost is Fr700 million HT (1991 prices). The proposal calls for financing in two stages. The first (five year) stage corresponds to construction of the machine and two-thirds of the beam lines; the second, also five years long, would see installation of the final one-third of the lines and introduction of experiments. Scientific justification: This takes into account the strong pressure for utilization of methodologies already mastered, openness toward other research sectors, and the possibility of new upstream research in the physics of radiation-matter interactions. For the source to have characteristics that meet these three objectives, three options were explicitly adopted: spectral range, temporal structure, and photon beam polarity. A doubly versatile machine was needed: coverage of both UV and x-ray bands by numerous insertion units, and operations at either high intensity or utilizing the unique temporal beam structure of this type of machine. Beyond the intensive discussions between engineers and researchers entailed by these objectives, an instrument was required which, from an interdisciplinary perspective, was optimized in an energy range where coupling of structural and electronic research is maximized. a) In atomic and molecular physical chemistry, the challenges first of all concern particles that are unstable or difficult to produce. These include radicals and transitory particles that govern elementary chemical reactions, van der Waals molecules and aggregates, the structure and reactivity of which are not precisely understood, and simple and multiple-charge ions found in plasmas, the ionosphere, or in interstellar space. Owing to high densities, high-resolution spectroscopy of these particles is essential. SOLEIL's high-flux capabilities, in the ultraviolet as well as x-ray region, will provide that resolution; its pulsed character will allow spectroscopy of threshold electrons and field ionization. Apart from current developments in ion disintegration (selective photochemical reactions, dissociation dynamics), this domain is not yet well developed, owing to insufficient intensities, whereas in this energy range the typical nuclear vibration cycles are equivalent in time-span to the duration period of gaps in the inner shells (10 fs [femtoseconds]), giving rise to interference effects not yet well explored. Finally, in this sector of research, SOLEIL will make it possible to perform experiments combining two sources of photons (RS [radioscopic source] + laser, or RS + free-electron laser) for the study of ionization of excited particles and dynamics of short-term dissociation (50 ps [picoseconds]) in order to understand transition states in the break-up of complex molecules. b) In biophysics, the demand of biocrystallographers in the areas of x-ray diffraction, diffusion, and absorption is constantly growing. The domains concerned, where the frantic pace of international competition impels us to decisive and immediate action, range from time crystallography to the study of molecular interaction with very large groups of molecules, to studies of microcrystal structure, to resolution of the phase problem by use of anomalous dispersion at variable wavelengths. In this respect, SOLEIL is complementary to existing facilities elsewhere, Grenoble in particular. The other category concerns the study, using pulse fluorometry, of dynamic and structural properties of proteins in solution and multimolecular systems (membranes, micells). Synchrotron radiation, which makes it possible to repeat a great number of measurements across a wide range of wavelengths of excitation, offers the only means of meeting this demand. The tunability of energy wavelengths and operability with small numbers of packets complement the picosecond laser measurements; the high flux levels of SOLEIL's undulators permit studies of weakly fluorescent samples as well as kinetic experiments with excellent quantification potential. c) In the domain of surfaces and interfaces, the synchrotron remains an essential tool, notwithstanding near-field microscopy. In the hard x-ray domain, ESRF opens up new possibilities, but a majority of experiments must continue to rely on an intense white source centered in the soft x-ray region (hv less than 3 keV), which ESRF covers rather poorly. By permitting x-ray absorption in polarized light, combined with anomalous glancing diffraction and stationary waves, it supports structural, electronic, and magnetic depiction of imbedded interfaces, which are of capital importance in miniaturized systems. With SOLEIL, angular photoemission and photodiffraction can be further improved with resolutions down to a few meV [millielectron volts]. Numerous domains (opening of \"gaps,\" quantic \"wells,\" Kondo effect) are sure to benefit. With polarization, photoemissivity will yield information on magnetic moments at the surface of magnetic materials. SOLEIL's capabilities will allow further progress in surface EXAFS [expanded x-ray absorption fine structure] and glancing-incidence diffraction on very thin heteroepitaxies, and much broader extension of the infrared spectroscopy work begun on the Super-ACO with vibrations of adsorbed molecules. The primary benefits will be very high resolutions (cm[.sup]-1[/]) and excellent sensitivity (up to 10[.sup]-3[/] unilayers). d) In the materials sciences, x-ray adsorption or diffraction is important in a great number of domains, in particular materials that are unordered on the large or very small scale (aggregates, films, multilayers). In addition, the recent trend away from stationary systems toward studies of the dynamics under stress of the crstallographic and electronic parameters of materials creates a considerable need, no more than one-third of which currently can be satisfied. In Project SOLEIL, the very important feature of polarization, especially in adsorption, will support structural anisotropy and studies of local magnetism by selective measurement of partial density of spin for a given type of atom. By virtue of the geometric characteristics and duration of beams, SOLEIL should greatly facilitate adsorption experiments not only at high resolution but also with multiple stresses. Another important and unique feature in the domain of adsorption, also linked to high resolution, has to do with K-threshold light-element spectroscopy (low-energy domain: 200-3,000 eV). The excellent extractability of different events at this level should make it possible to obtain direct structural information simply by examining structures near the thresholds. With other structural methods (diffusion and diffraction), SOLEIL will continue to provide a useful service for a traditional but wider community: that of occasional users who, having extracted the maximum information compatible with their semi-heavy equipment, employ the source for its white spectrum and its wavelength tunability, its linear and circular polarization capacities, and its microsecond temporal beam structuring. It can be predicted that such users, given the nature of their needs, will not be using high-energy source such as ESRF over the medium term. These users want a high-quality, easily accessed source of intermediate energy that incorporates recent progress and responds to their needs. This large community must not be forgotten, because it plays a very important role in current developments on new materials: quasicrystals, superconductors, multilayers, fullerenes, etc. Site of the machine: Much of the LURE laboratory's current success is a function of the exceptionally fine scientific environment in which it is situated: the immediate vicinity of the University of Orsay and the Saclay nuclear studies center, close to the large universities of Paris. At the technical level, LURE has considerable drawing power vis-a-vis the large nearby CEA and IN2P3 laboratories. Current estimates of the cost of the project assume a site on the Saclay plateau, at Orme des Merisiers, where 15 hectares of land belonging to CEA is available. The land and soil characteristics--important to consider--are excellent. Assuming a site outside Ile-de-France [the Paris region], one would have to take into account, in addition to problems of accessibility, the currently strong interaction with the local science and technology community, and the percentage of researchers and engineers willing to accompany the project away from Orsay, and the costs such a transplantation would entail: creation of new work areas, reception facilities, ease of access to site, scientific environment, etc. At all events, a gradual disappearance of large installations at the Orsay-Saclay complex would seriously weaken this important scientific hub. Remarks and recommendations of the Council: At the current stage of the proposal, the Council is not in a position to issue precise recommendations. The usefulness for the French scientific community of having a machine such as SOLEIL seems to admit of little doubt. As a scientific instrument it would complement the ESRF, toward which France makes a heavy financial contribution: Assurances would be needed that the communities concerned have the capacity to exploit them both. The most difficult problem with which institutions affected by the project must concern themselves is how to finance it. Projections of TGE-related expenditures presented in the first part of this report appear to leave no resources available, in the short term, to finance construction of SOLEIL unless these institutions receive significantly larger allocations for TGEs. The Council is thus waiting for these institutions to submit precise proposals exploring all the possibilities. Project LHC In its 1991 report, the Council examined the LHC issue, which at the time was presented in a preliminary form that required future technical and financial studies. With the information then at its disposal, the Council was in a position to \"recommend that France maintain a positive attitude in pursuit of negotiations to secure approval of the project by the member states of CERN, provided however that the growth in our own contribution remain limited and that the companion appropriations necessary to build the detectors must for the most part be found by redeploying current budgets in the discipline.\" At its meeting in September 1992, the Council undertook to review the status of progress in the decision-making process and on preparation of the detector proposal. The TGE Council took note of an important resolution of the CERN Council, adopted unanimously at its December 1991 meeting. In that resolution, the CERN Council declared: - \"that in every respect the LHC is the right machine to ensure the future of CERN and continuation of its mission;\" - that before the end of 1993 the director general shall furnish detailed information on the cost and participation of member and nonmember states, to enable the Council to move toward a decision on the LHC; in particular, information is required on the following points: --technical feasibility of the project; --best estimate of the final cost of the machine, sources of finance, and timetable for delivery of components; --details of the program of experimentation, its objectives, and direct costs to CERN, as well as indirect costs that will have to be borne by the financing agencies of the principal participating institutions. The year 1992 was marked by important progress in design and preparation of the LHC: - the injection system, utilizing existing accelerators (including the 26-GeV PS and the 450-GeV SPS), was tested successfully; - the machine's grid was optimized. Maximum energy of 7.7 TeV [teraelectron volts] will be obtained with a field of 9.5 Tesla; - installation of half the (4 x 12 kW) cryogenic stations is under way as part of Project LEP 200. These stations will also be used for the LHC; - fabrication of prototypes of the superconducting magnets is progressing at a satisfactory pace. With regard to the strategy for preparation of the experimentation program, the Council heard a presentation from J.E. Augustin, president of the ECFA (European Committee for Future Accelerators). At the European level, the strategy is being developed in cooperation with CERN's committee on scientific directives and with ECFA. Important steps were taken in 1992, in particular at an important colloquium held at Evian in March, where 650 physicists from 30 countries met for a broad discussion of possible experiments and the detectors needed to conduct them. In November, CERN hosted a meeting for public presentation of the \"letters of intent\" prepared by three collaborative teams that hope to build and operate a detector. Only two detectors can be installed adjoining the machine, and the LHC committee on experiments will therefore have to make its decisions before the close of 1993--probably thereby encouraging some restructuring of the groups: - the ATLAS team has chosen a magnetic field created by a large toroid, which permits precise measurement of muons, complemented by a superconducting coil in the center. The electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry uses a liquid argon detector; - the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) team proposes to install a high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeter (CeF[.sup]3[/] crystals) inside a large superconducting solenoid (3-meter radius) providing a 4-Tesla field; - the L3P (Lepton and Proton Precision Physics) team proposes far-reaching modifications to the L3 detector installed for the LEP, to adapt it to the LHC. French teams are strongly represented in ATLAS and to a lesser degree in CMS and L3P. Their research and development efforts have focused on calorimetry, trace measurement, and radiation-resistant electronics. They have often come up with innovative solutions. Each team involves between 400 and 900 researchers representing 50 to 90 laboratories. Depending on which proposals are accepted, the estimated cost (exclusive of salaries) would be between 300 and 450 million Swiss francs per detector. France's cumulative investment in LEP detectors amounts to Fr170 million (1983 francs), or Fr240 million in 1993 currency. Assuming a French contribution of 15 percent of the total cost of the two LHC detectors, and taking the lower cost estimate (600 million Swiss francs), we obtain a burden of about Fr350 million, or 50 percent more than France's cumulative investment in LEP detectors. The Council remains concerned by the magnitude of the financial burden which institutions will have to shoulder to participate at an appropriate level in construction of these detectors. It wishes to obtain detailed information from them on how they plan to accomplish this, given that the majority of such financing will have to be found by internal reprogramming, as it already recommended in 1991. The Council is also waiting to be provided with all the information promised to the member-state delegations by the CERN directorate--in principle before the end of 1993--before rendering a definitive opinion on the project.

However, the effect that this has on temperature is not known. Thin ice clouds bring about warming, whereas thick clouds cause cooling; which effect predominates is not known. Raising Profits by Using Less Fuel Meanwhile, engineers are seeking ``new aircraft engine designs that will consume 10 to 20 percent less kerosine and discharge up to 80 percent less nitrogen oxide,'' says Jost Schmidt, head of Munich- based MTU's development division. Fuel still accounts for about a third of an aircarft's overall running costs, and a 2-percent cut in running costs would double an airline's annual profits. Moreover, there are countries that levy an environment duty: For instance, the Swedish government has for four years been levying an emission- dependent tax on civil aircraft landing at Swedish airports. There is a large market waiting for the engine builders: Experts put sales over the next 10 years at $120 billion in the civil sector alone. However, the cost of a research program to develop a new type of engine is put at $1-2 billion, an investment that the experts say would take about 15 years to amortize. Four years ago, Pratt &amp; Whitney, FiatAvio, and MTU formed a joint venture to build the advanced ducted propulsion (ADP) proposed by Pratt &amp; Whitney engineers and prepare it for testing. The project is linked to an experimental and engineering program for future propulsion systems subsidized by the Research Ministry in Bonn, which has already poured a total of 100 million German marks into the project. A test proptype of this new engine successfully underwent initial trials on a test bench in Florida just under a year ago, and special functions, such as the reverse thrust, have just been tested in a NASA wind tunnel in California. ADP is based partially on conventional principles but operates with greater efficiency than current engines. The engineers have achieved this result by substantially raising what is known as the by-pass ratio. Part of the air normally flows through the inner core area, while the rest flows past it on the outside, providing the desired propulsion. The drawback inherent in raising this by- pass ratio is that it increases engine diameter by about 50 percent. If the advantage of lower fuel consumption is not to be canceled out by the weight gain, new materials must be developed that will be as light as possible while withstanding extreme loads. MTU is therefore undertaking research into fiber-reinforced composites about three times as light as titanium. The engineers are confident that ADP will be in use by the turn of the century. An MTU idea known as CRISP (counter-rotating integrated shrouded propfan) goes a step further, having not the usual single rotor at the engine intake, but two rotating in opposite directions, thus increasing the air throughput. However, CRISP research is currently on the ``back burner'' for financial reasons. Hydrogen Brings Problems Last but not least, ``alternative'' fuels are still being fielded as a means of reducing exhaust emissions. Veritable miracles are being attributed to hydrogen in particular, although engines running on hydrogen discharge double the amount of water vapor emitted by a conventional engine and would thus increase cloud formation. Moreover, the assumption that an aircraft running on hydrogen would discharge nothing but water vapor is false. NASA research showed 20 years ago that at high combustion temperatures nitrogen oxidizes out of air to form nitrogen oxides. Discharges of these gases cannot actually be reduced by introducing alternative fuels: New, more efficient combustion chambers would be required even in this case. Creating them would entail exploring virgin territory in engineering, because the hydrogen has to be cooled to below minus 252 degrees Celsius in the tanks, with the risk that components might ice up or become brittle. Moreover, energy content for energy content, hydrogen is four times more voluminous than kerosine, so additional tanks would inevitably have to be incorporated."

This was the sixth edition of the biennial conference following those held in Tokyo, Chicago, Karlsruhe, Kyoto, and Clearwater. One of the short-term objectives of the EC is the construction of an experimental reactor as part of global cooperation. It will be based on the magnetic confinement of deuterium and tritium plasma, followed by the design and construction of a demonstration reactor. The experimental fusion reactor, named ITER [International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor], is to be built around the year 2000 and already involves major research efforts into materials, subjected to the extreme service conditions which cause their deterioration. The international conference in Stresa, attended by 400 scientists from 23 countries (for the first time there was a major delegation from Russia), examined the mechanisms of degradation and the remedies for expanding the working potential of materials for fusion reactors. More specifically materials can be developed which, though becoming partially radioactive due to the neutrons generated by the fusion process, will be able to lose their radioactivity gradually within 20-30 years. By using this type of material the energy generated by the fusion process may become clean. [passage missing]"

The Flying-Research Institute (LII) imeni M.M. Gromov, Aviaeksport Association, and the German firm Glahe International organized it. The exhibition received experts and journalists from 11 through 14 August and everyone who wished to attend on 15 and 16 August, and an air show was conducted on 16 August in honor of Air Force Day. The exhibition took place at an airfield belonging to LII, the main VPP [runway] of which is 5,500 meters long. There are no such large airfields in Europe, and only the airfield at Edwards Air Base in the United States can be compared to it. Russia spent 85 million rubles [R] to organize the air show, of which R60 million was spent on construction of roads and city infrastructure and R25 million on development of the exhibition complex itself. A portion of the expenditures was covered by the cost of entry tickets. With the price of a ticket at R30, the amount of proceeds from entry payments totaled more than R8 million and, considering the lease payments by the exhibitors, we can assume that a large portion of the cost of the exhibition complex was covered. The \"Mosaeroshow-92\" organizers managed to develop the aerospace exhibition complex in a record short period of time (3.5 months). The exhibition complex hardly lags behind the most famous aircraft exhibition complex in the world at Le Bourget (near Paris). The opportunity that was offered to domestic aerospace enterprises to show their items at \"Mosaeroshow-92\" completely meets the assigned task to market domestic products. This opportunity is valuable first of all for the producers and developers of aircraft equipment, few of whom are capable of systematically participating in foreign exhibitions. According to data cited in a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interview with OKB [Experimental Design Bureau] imeni A.I. Mikoyan general designer R.A. Belkov, in 1991 not a single aircraft from their OKB was sold abroad. A dramatic decline in exports was observed in the entire domestic defense industry in 1991. A certain bias on the part of a number of potential foreign purchasers regarding Russian arms as a result of their unsuccessful employment during the course of the Persian Gulf War is among the primary causes of this, as well as the lack of sophistication of domestic sales structures and possible pressure on the Russian Government by the United States. Exhibitions of the \"Mosaeroshow-92\" type will help to disperse the bias arising from inadequately thorough analysis of combat operations and knowledge of Russian equipment.  The conclusion of the RUSSIAN \"MOSAEROSHOW-92\" AEROSPACE EXHIBITION survey is in No. 42."

            "text": "Language: Estonian Article Type:CSO [Article by Aap Tanav: \"Niitenberg Not Afraid of Nuclear Plants\"] The Daughter of Estonia's Energy Minister Arvo Niitenberg Is Involved In Liquidating Accidents at Nuclear Plants [Text] \"I have been telling my Western colleagues that had they had a steep price hike like we had in Estonia, they would have had rioting in the streets,\" says energy minister Arvo Niitenberg smugly, as he recalls the economic crisis of the 70's in the United States. At that time, Americans raised the price of a liter of gasoline by 10 cents, and there were incidents of shooting at gas stations. Estonia's energetics has survived a major price shock over the past two years. Coal, heating oil, natural gas, diesel fuel and gasoline have been brought to world market prices. \"Oil shale and electricity are not at world market prices,\" says Niitenberg, satisfied that Estonia has moved into world economy. The price of gasoline in Estonia and the world price of unprocessed crude are now linked. One dramatic example of relentlessly rising prices is the 754-time jump in the price of natural gas, as compared to the Soviet era. The minister believes that our energy policy which, in its formative stages, drew praise from its teachers like the World Bank, the European Bank of Development and Reconstruction, and other organizations, will make Estonia stronger in the future. The days of wasting cheap energy are over. No More Sudden Price Hikes \"As is happening elsewhere, the price of energy in Estonia will still be going up, but I don't foresee any sudden jumps,\" says Niitenberg and finds that the price of electricity, for example, is favorably low, compared to some of our neighbors. He does not believe that the price of electricity will ever go up to Finland's level (5 times higher than ours), and that Estonia will always have an advantage. Electricity is unnaturally cheap in Russia but, compared to other neighboring states, Estonian producers enjoy a certain advantage. While the consumption of electricity has been going up lately, the demand for liquid fuel has been dropping. During 1993, only 600,000 tonnes of heating oil were consumed, compared to its previous consumption levels of up to 1,600,000 tonnes a year. \"Part of that difference is attributable to user economy, the rest to a general economic decline. I believe we can increase production without drastically increasing the demand for energy. We have to reduce the energy loss that currently amounts to roughly one third of the total. If that part of the energy could be used to develop the economy, energy expenditures would not have to go up for the time being,\" Niitenberg says. As an example, he cites Denmark, where energy consumption goes up by less than 1 percent, yet the economy is developing at a much faster rate. This is the result of energy conservation programs. The Danes have made a transition to more modern heating systems, they have financing. Estonia, by contrast, is plagued by lack of capital. The Proportion of Domestic Fuel Is Small \"For the development of energetics, we have received loans from the European Community totaling 76.7 million Estonian kroons. With that money, more than 140 energy-related projects have been carried out in different parts of Estonia. These have been mostly small plants for local parish use, installed to make a transition to domestic fuel, and to reduce energy loss,\" Niitenberg says. The proportion of domestic fuel sources is currently not as great in Estonia as it is in our neighboring countries. Timber and peat provide 3.5 percent of the necessary energy. In the Nordic countries, this share is roughly 7 percent; in Finland between 12 and 13 percent. \"It would be possible to increase the share of timber and peat to 10 percent. It is interesting to note that, even though Estonia imports much of its fuel, close to 70 percent of the energy is obtained locally. In this respect we are much better off than Latvia or Lithuania. We have oil shale, electricity, timber and peat, only liquid fuel and natural gas are brought in,\" Niitenberg says. Estonia Needs an Explosives Plant Out of the production cost for oil shale, one third goes for explosives which, for the time being, are still coming from our eastern neighbors. Prices of explosives and fuses have gone up and that, in turn, has jacked up the price of oil shale. Eesti Polevkivi [Estonian Oil Shale] is in the process of negotiating with a Swedish and a German firm for putting up an explosives plant in Estonia, specifically for mining. Depending on technology, this will require an investment of roughly $5 to $10 million. A study is being conducted to show how fast the plant can pay for itself. \"Last year, 13.5 million tonnes of oil shale were produced in Estonia, and I cannot see that volume going down in the near future. We can tell potential foreign buyers that the market is stable, and give them certain guarantees,\" Niitenberg thinks. Send Us Pressure Pipe, Not Experts Both firms are interested, but are still busy looking for marketing possibilities in other nearby regions. Niitenberg thinks there are certain advantages to investing in Estonia. It is not like dealing with the Third World countries, who cannot manage on their own. We have technical know-how and an industrial infra-structure. All we need is modern technology. \"In my dealings with foreigners, I have had to repeat, time and again, please believe me, we also have experts. We would rather have 300 meters of pressure pipe than seven experts,\" says Niitenberg, convinced that Estonia can offer some excellent specialists in the area of energetics. In addition to capital, we also lack the skill of organizing the work. A Strategic Reserve Would Be Necessary Lack of capital also stands in the way of creating a strategic reserve of fuel. Niitenberg is a believer in having strategic reserves, the only question being what is the most effective way of using the financial resources available. For Estonia to to maintain a three-month reserve of liquid fuel, would tie up $300 to $400 million. \"Estonia is not rich enough to let such amounts sit idle. First, a decision needs to be made how much of a reserve should be maintained. This presumes that we know what we want to be insured against. We have the facilities for storing liquid fuel, but not for natural gas, 100 percent of which comes in from Russia. Putting those up would take an extremely large investment, the closest usable storage facilities are located in Latvia,\" Niitenberg says, adding that the question of strategic reserves has been discussed in government and has been assigned to the working group of the Economic Ministry. The problem is wider in scope, and includes the areas of medicine, food and other such. Refining Plant To Cost $1 Billion Canada, where Niitenberg worked for many years in leading positions within the energy system, had a relatively low level of reserves. Emphasis was placed on infra-structure, making sure that fuel could be moved immediately whenever needed. The reserves of liquid fuel were distributed between big oil companies, with the state keeping track of how fast some company or other could obtain a certain quantity of fuel. Most of the responsibility was borne by Petro Canada, a company similar to our Eesti Kutus [Estonian Fuel]. There is always the question: Can the state place an obligation on a private company? \"In case of a possible crisis, we have two choices. Either we have barrels stored somewhere, or we have a firm plan for how to transport the necessary amount of fuel from some refining plant in Denmark or Poland to Estonia within three days. Putting up our own plant would require a capital outlay of $800 to $900 million, whereas transportation, storage and other support services for import have improved significantly as of late. \"In Canada, I dealt with electricity that could not be kept in reserve. For unexpected situations, alternatives had to be found,\" Niitenberg says. A Nuclear Plant Does Not Have To Be Hazardous Among specialists, there has also been talk about putting up a nuclear power plant in Estonia. Speaking of money, Niitenberg volunteered the cost of the Darlington nuclear power plant as an example. Ontario Hydro, the Canadian company where Niitenberg worked before coming to Estonia, and where he still has a position waiting for him, invested 14 billion Canadian dollars in building this 3,600 MW capacity power plant. This project, designed for an operating life of 30 to 40 years, is not expected to turn a profit for the first 10 years. \"The possibility of putting up a nuclear power plant should be analyzed, above all, from an economic point of view. If the potential profit is a mere two cents per kilowatt, it will obviously not be worth the risk. It would be a completely different situation, however, if the nuclear plant would enable us to produce electricity at half the previous cost. One of the biggest burdens imaginable is a nuclear plant that does not work efficiently or does not have a sufficient load. However, atomic power plants can turn out to be extremely profitable. We should not dismiss any of the alternatives on simply emotional grounds, even though we know what happened at Chernobyl and what is going on in Paldiski, where the biggest danger is over by now,\" says Niitenberg, who was in charge of 20 nuclear power plants in Canada, and who has a daughter involved in liquidating nuclear power plant accidents. \"As long as everything is well organized, this field is not as dangerous as it is thought to be. If that were not so, I would not have allowed my daughter to work in this field. It is significant that, in accordance with international agreements, information should be disclosed on any accident so that appropriate conclusions could be drawn by nuclear energy specialists in neighboring countries and throughout the world. At Chernobyl, this agreement was violated,\" Niitenberg explained. Future Will Bring New Solutions Niitenberg thinks that this issue will not come up on Estonia's agenda before the year 2000, for sure, and that it will take a political decision, in principle, either by politicians or by a referendum. As far as the future of energetics for the whole world goes, Niitenberg does not deign offer anything specific. \"If I knew the solution, I would become a very rich man,\" he laughs and thinks that bio-energetics will develop, for sure. Also feasible is the so-called fusion method, which is the next step in harnessing nuclear energy, based on the ability of heavy hydrogen isotopes to combine into helium at extremely high temperatures, yielding energy from the neutron thus released. To the question about current fuel reserves and how long they will last, Niitenberg replies with another question: For what kind of money? Canada has supposedly more crude oil than all Arab countries combined but, due to natural conditions, pumping it out would cost 30 times more than the current norm."

Such targets are used in laser thermonuclear fusion experiments at the Iskra-4 and Iskra-5 facilities. The material used for the coatings is liquid and solid deuterium or a deuterium-tritium mixture, as well as beryllium and titanium hydrides and polyethylene containing deuterium and tritium. An annotated diagram of the cryogenic unit for preparing a target in the interaction chamber is given. The technology for preparing cryogenic targets and their installation in the interaction chamber is fully explained in the text. This technology is similar to that developed in the United States (such as D. L. Musinski, et al., APPL. PHYS. LETTS, 34, 300, 1979). The method makes it possible to obtain a cryogenic target 100-300 m in diameter and 0.5-2 m thick. Details of the method are given. For example, the behavior of the cryolayer was registered by a motion picture survey of the shadow pattern or interferogram; holographic interferometry was used for more precise measurements of the thickness and uniformity of the cryolayer. Additional information is given on the procedures for controlling and monitoring the parameters and behavior of the layer. Figures 7; references 15: 13 Russian, 2 Western."

Antonov, V.Yu. Prikhodin, S.V. Chivanov, Yu.P. Kozmin, V.A. Shishkov; UDC 536.24:66.045.1] [Abstract] The increasing stringency of the requirements imposed on the economic and environmental indicators of aircraft gas turbine engines (AGTD) brought to the forefront the issue of using liquefied hydrogen or natural gas as motor fuel which calls for preliminary fuel gasification in a special heat exchanger. The development of such heat exchangers-gasifiers is fraught with a number of problems, e.g., selecting the heat exchanger location, ensuring a stable cryogenic fuel flow in the heat exchanger channels, selecting the fuel preheating regime, etc. The solution to these problems is complicated by a lack of reliable design methods. To bridge this gap, an attempt is made to develop an analysis technique using the example of heat exchanger-gasifiers for NK-88 and NK-89 engines. The design of the heat exchanger and heat and mass transfer processes during cryogenic fuel gasification are described in detail, a mathematical model of the process is formulated, and an algorithm for solving the resulting equations is proposed. The analytical method of designing heat exchangers for cryogenic fuel gasification with two-phase flow conditions inside the pipes and frosting on the outside surface is verified experimentally. The maximum spread between the analytical and experimental data is within 15-25% which attests to the mathematical model's adequacy for practical applications.

Introduction We seek to expand the use of solar-derived light, heat, water and wind power and other forms of natural energy in order to reduce our reliance on nonrenewable fossil fuel energy in the 21st century. In a society with this orientation toward energy, we believe, as shown in Figure 1, that hydrogen, easily stored, transported, and converted to and from electricity, will play a crucial role as an energy medium, together with electricity produced from natural energy. Hydrogen is also converted to water when burned and can be used without disturbance to natural biosystems, while its convertibility with water provides a virtually limitless supply, as shown in Figure 2. Thus hydrogen is of interest as the ultimate fuel capable of providing long-term, mass quantity supply. A large-scale project aiming at Canadian-European utilization of electricity and hydrogen energy is already underway&lt;sup&gt; 1)&lt;/sup&gt; as shown in Figure 3. As depicted in Figure 3, automobile fuel is considered one of the main ways in which hydrogen will be used. As one proposal for such, we prototyped the hydrogen rotary engine-equipped HR-X concept car (Figure 4) and showed it at the 29th Tokyo Motor Show held in Fall, 1991. The HR-X attracted considerable public interest as a vehicle that will contribute to a clean, ecological world and was subsequently shown at other events around the globe, including the June, 1992 global summit on environmental problems in Brazil. The car is increasing awareness and anticipation of hydrogen vehicles. In this paper, we discuss the background and objectives of hydrogen rotary engine (RE below) development, the advantages of using RE as hydrogen engines, the achievement of high output through a system for direct injection of hydrogen into cylinders (``direct injection'' below), and the results of our studies on emission characteristics, etc. Figure 1. Role of Hydrogen Energy Figure 2. Hydrogen Combustion and Regeneration Figure 3. Euro-Quebec Hydro-Hydrogen Project 2. Development Background and Objectives During the oil crises of the 1970s, hydrogen engines attracted the attention of specialists as alternative energy engines, and with the recent criticality of global environmental problems, they have again drawn attention from these quarters as clean engines. Research towards commercialization is continuing both in and out of Japan. According to the basic characteristics shown in Table 1, hydrogen has a high calorific value, and if operated with the same amount of air and theoretical air/fuel ratio as a gasoline engine, the calorific value with a hydrogen engine will be 15&percnt; higher than with gasoline, as shown in Figure 5. However, since the minimum ignition energy is a very low one-tenth that of gasoline, engine regions not hot enough to cause a problem in gasoline engines, such as spark plugs and exhaust valves, as well as residual exhaust gas, etc. become igniters and are believed to easily cause premature ignition, backfire, and other abnormal combustion. Since premature ignition, backfire, and other abnormal combustion occurs readily in comparison to typical gasoline engines, research on conventional hydrogen engines has reported declining output performance or structural complexity caused by countermeasures, etc.&lt;sup&gt; 2)3)&lt;/sup&gt; Noting that the distinctive structure of our proprietary RE were effective in preventing abnormal hydrogen combustion, we began development of hydrogen RE as clean, high-performance automobile engines designed to support a 21st century society making use of hydrogen energy. 3.3 Experiments (1) Effect of Fuel Supply System We studied the effects of differences in fuel supply systems on output limits. Figure 8 shows the results of a comparison of a premix system and an intake stroke injection system. Since output declines with mixtures richer than the theoretical air/fuel ratio (&lgr;=1), evaluation was made up to &lgr;=1. Under full loading and with throttle valves fully open, a premix system RE was successfully operated at up to 5,000 rpm with &lgr;=1. However, output became unstable at 6,500 rpm, with &lgr;=1.4, and the excess air ratio (&lgr;) could not be reduced at higher speeds. In contrast, an intake stroke injection system RE was successfully operated at up to 6,500 rpm near &lgr;=1. We feel this is due to the production of non-uniform fuel regions with the intake stroke injection system, and a resulting weaker air/fuel ratio in mixture air near ignition sources than with premixing. The following studies were made on the intake stroke injection system, superior in output. (2) Effect of Spark Plug Heating Value We investigated the optimum spark plug heating value for hydrogen. Spark plugs were those used with ordinary gasoline specifications; leading side spark plugs (``L plugs'' below) had a heating value of 5 (heating values follow product numbers of NGK Spark Plug Co. (Inc.)) and trailing side spark plugs (``T plugs'' below) had a heating value of 10. As the hydrogen quantity was increased from leanness, which inhibits abnormal combustion, premature ignition began to occur at an excess air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.6. Figure 9 shows indicator waves for the working chamber pressure when premature ignition occurred. Premature ignition first occurred noncontinuously, gradually occurring sooner and continuously, and finally occurring continuously in the migrating working chamber, [beginning] immediately after spark plug exposure during compression. From the course of this occurrence, we surmised that spark plugs become igniters, causing premature ignition which further raises spark plug temperature, increasing the frequency and quickening the occurrence of premature ignition. To verify this theory, we investigated the relationship between premature ignition and heating values by substituting spark plugs with effectively high heating values for the low temperature spark plugs. As shown in Figure 10, the excess air ratio (&lgr;) at which premature ignition began declined after an increase in spark plug heating values from the gasoline-specification heating value of 5. As a result, we learned that normal operation is possible even at &lgr;=1 when heating values are raised to 13. Consequently, it became clear that spark plugs were the ignition source for the premature ignition in Figure 9, and that abnormal combustion can be avoided even at &lgr;=1 through the use of spark plugs with a high heating value. In supplementary experiments, we found that the heating value of L plugs affected the occurrence of premature ignition. Figure 10. Effect of Spark Plug Heating Value on Premature (3) Effect of Gas Escape From Plug Holes Though the use of spark plugs with a heating value of 13 and the adoption of an intake stroke injection system for fuel supply allowed operation at &lgr;=1 over nearly all regions, instability did at times occur during maximum output at 6,500 rpm near &lgr;=1. Accordingly, we investigated its cause using a pressure indicator diagram. Figure 11 shows changes in the indicator diagram when instability occurred. Unlike Figure 9, sudden shifts from normal combustion to premature ignition are apparent. The absence of any signs of spark plug-induced premature ignition, and the passage of apex seals over L plug holes immediately prior to the occurrence of premature ignition led us to believe that mixture air uncombusted during the compression stroke passes through L plug holes, comes in contact with hot, burning gases during the expansion stroke, and is ignited. We felt that the size and volume of L plug holes would affect the occurrence of this phenomenon and therefore investigated the effect of changing L plug hole volume by changing L plug ejection quantities. As shown in Figure 12, we learned that the excess air ratio (&lgr;) during the occurrence of output instability can be reduced by increasing the ejection quantity; that is, by decreasing L plug hole volume. Figure 11. Indicator Waves During Occurrence of Premature Figure 12.

For P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.1 MPa, a peak was reached near &lgr;=3. Where heat efficiency is concerned, the leaner the mixture, the better for pumping loss and specific heat ratio, but isochorism declines and combustion deteriorates, and we believe that the balance of both sets of factors forms the peak. For P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.29 MPa, throttle valves were fully open at &lgr;=2.5, and a peak net heat efficiency of 28&percnt; was reached at such time. Figure 13. Heat Efficiency vs. Air/Fuel Ratio (2) Output Performance Figure 14 compares hydrogen RE and hydrogen CE at 2,500 rpm through the relationship of excess air ratio (&lgr;) and output. As the excess air ratio (&lgr;) falls, output increases. However the air/fuel ratio in the hydrogen CE could not be enriched above &lgr;=1.8 due to backfire. Higher output was obtained with the hydrogen RE, which allowed operation up to &lgr;=1. As a result, while only 50&percnt; of gasoline-specification output was obtained with the (premix system) hydrogen CE, 63&percnt; and 75&percnt; outputs were obtained with the hydrogen RE premix and intake stroke injection systems, respectively. Figure 14. Abnormal Combustion Thresholds (3) Exhaust Gas Performance Figure 15 shows the relationship between NOx and excess air ratio (&lgr;) at 1,500 rpm and respective loads of P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.1 MPa and P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.29 MPa. For P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.1 MPa, NOx are nearly zero above &lgr;=1.5; and for P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.29 MPa, nearly zero above &lgr;=2.0. Figure 15. NOx Exhaust Characteristics 3.5 Results and Issues in Suitability Testing The following was learned from our studies of RE suitability for hydrogen. (1) RE show high performance in preventing backfire and can be operated at &lgr;=1 over a broad range if spark plugs with a heating value suited to hydrogen are used. (2) While only 50&percnt; of gasoline-specification output was obtained with a premix system hydrogen CE, 63&percnt; of gasoline-specification output was obtained with a hydrogen RE. Additionally, 75&percnt; of gasoline-specification output was successfully obtained with the structurally simpler intake stroke injection system. (3) High heat efficiency and clean exhaust gas is obtained under partial loading if operation is pursued at &lgr;=2-3. From the above results, we found that hydrogen RE require no structural changes or attachment of special devices to prevent abnormal combustion near the theoretical air/fuel ratio capable of drawing maximum output; merely switching to spark plugs with a heating value suited to engine requirements is sufficient. It is thus demonstrated that RE possess a structure which is fundamentally easily adaptable to hydrogen engines, for which preventing abnormal combustion is the most important concern. Nonetheless, the 75&percnt; of gasoline-specification output obtained even through operation at the theoretical air/fuel ratio is low. Likewise, since air and hydrogen are simultaneously injected by the intake stroke injection system we studied, air quantity during intake is reduced approximately 30&percnt; by hydrogen volume, and volumetric efficiency is low. Accordingly, we report our study of a direct injection system designed to solve this problem by supplying hydrogen directly to cylinders immediately after completion of the intake stroke. 4. Development of Hydrogen RE Direct Injection Systems 4.1 Goal The decline in the volumetric efficiency of air that is the second cause of reduced hydrogen CE output depicted in Figure 5 stems from the low density that is one hydrogen characteristic indicated in Table 1, and this characteristic is likewise a cause of reduced output in hydrogen RE. Specifically, low density gaseous hydrogen occupies a large 28&percnt; volume of total gas mixture in the theoretical air/fuel ratio, in contrast to the mere 1.7&percnt; occupied by gasoline vapor. And even when the gas mixture naturally input to a premix system, in which hydrogen is mixed in the intake pipes, is considered quantitatively the same as that in a gasoline engine, the amount of air therein is far less, as shown in Figure 16. Counteractive methods for direct injection of hydrogen into the working chamber after completion of air intake have been researched&lt;sup&gt; 4)5)&lt;/sup&gt; , and we investigated their effectiveness in hydrogen RE. Since the volumetric ratio of air to hydrogen in the theoretical air/fuel ratio is 72:28, mixed gas volumetric efficiency might be raised to a maximum 138&percnt; if direct injection raises the volumetric efficiency of air alone to near 100&percnt;, as shown in Figure 16. We also studied the exhaust characteristics of hydrogen fuel, reported to be completely free from conversion to noxious substances. Water is essentially the only combustion product of hydrogen, but a certain amount of lubricating oil carried into the working chamber in an actual hydrogen engine is burned and produces trace amounts of HC, CO, and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; . Additionally, atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen bond in the high temperatures of the working chamber, forming NOx. Our studies of hydrogen RE included exhaust characteristics of these emissions. Figure 16. Quantitative Differences in Supply By Hydrogen 4.2 Experimental Method and Apparatus In systems for direct injection of hydrogen, both low pressure direct injection (roughly 1 MPa or less) early in the compression stroke and high pressure direct injection (roughly 8-10 MPa) late in the compression stroke have been researched. In low pressure direct injection, the long duration from injection to spark provides superior mixing with air, however high pressure direct injection allows injection immediately before the spark and prevents premature ignition. As clarified in the previous section, the basic structure of the RE easily allows prevention of premature ignition, thus the need for high pressure injection is slight, and we felt that low pressure injection involving a simpler apparatus was appropriate. We therefore prototyped a hydrogen RE with a low pressure direct injection system and studied improvements in output performance. Figure 17 shows the structure and operation of the prototyped hydrogen RE with direct injection system. Atop a side housing where gasoline specifications locate an intake port is an air port for intake of air alone, and above that is an added hydrogen port. A poppet-type hydrogen valve opened and closed by the cam shaft is located in the flow of a hydrogen port opening on the wall of the working chamber for the intake stroke. As shown in Figure 18, hydrogen is injected into the working chamber for the compression stroke for an interval of approximately 90 degrees (main shaft angle) starting immediately after the end of air intake through the air port. In the left drawing of Figure 17, air is being drawn into the working chamber during the intake stroke, and the hydrogen valve is still closed. The right drawing depicts a point during the compression stroke at which the air port has closed, the hydrogen port opens, and hydrogen is being injected from the hydrogen port towards the air in the working chamber. The pressure of the injected hydrogen is 1.0 MPa or less. To discern the effect of the direct injection system, we jointly studied a premix system supplying hydrogen to an intake manifold. Figure 17. Structure and Operation of Direct Injection Figure 18. Timing of Air and Hydrogen Supply 4.3 Volumetric Efficiency Figure 19 shows a comparison of a direct injection system and a premix system through the relationship between excess air ratio (&lgr;) and volumetric efficiency. In the direct injection system, only air is input naturally from the intake port, while in the premix system, an air and hydrogen mixture is input naturally. The volumetric efficiency in both is roughly equivalent. The slightly lower air quantity in the direct injection system is ascribed to the effect of residual hydrogen in the channel from the hydrogen valve to the hydrogen port which is carried in during the intake stroke. When volumetric efficiency for hydrogen-air mixtures are compared, the difference between the direct injection system and the premix system grows with the richness of the mixture, and the direct injection system is approximately 20&percnt; greater at the theoretical air/fuel ratio. Thus we see that conversion to direct injection more strongly affects the premature ignition and abnormal combustion-determined operating threshold in hydrogen RE, where this limit extends to richness close to the theoretical air/fuel ratio. Figure 20 shows volumetric efficiency for an air-hydrogen mixture versus engine speed under full loading. Conversion to direct injection increases volumetric efficiency 20-30&percnt; at all speeds. The volumetric efficiency of a hydrogen-containing mixture in a direct injection engine thus exceeds 100&percnt; at 2,000 rpm and above. Figure 19. Volumetric Efficiency vs. Excess Air Ratio Figure 20. Volumetric Efficiency vs. Engine Revolution 4.4 Heat Efficiency Figure 21 shows changes in net heat efficiency versus excess air ratio (&lgr;) during wide open operation at 2,000 rpm. Compared to the premix system, the net heat efficiency of the direct injection system is seen to deteriorate roughly 2&percnt; in the lean region near &lgr;=2, and approximately 1&percnt; near &lgr;=1. These results are thought to show deteriorating combustion due to conversion to direct injection. To compare practical heat efficiency, Figure 22 shows changes in net heat efficiency versus net mean effective pressure. The direct injection system is somewhat worse than the premix system under low loading, but conversely better under high loading. The reason is that the direct injection system, with its high volumetric efficiency for air, operates leaner than the premix system under an identical load. We therefore feel that the decline in heat efficiency due to richness becomes a benefit in the large range of high loading. Figure 21. Heat Efficiency vs. Excess Air Ratio Figure 22. Heat Efficiency vs. Mean Effective Pressure 4.5 Output Performance (1) Excess Air Ratio Characteristics Figure 23 shows changes in net mean effective pressure versus excess air ratio (&lgr;) during wide open operation at 2,000 rpm. Net mean effective pressure peaks near &lgr;=1 for the premix system and near &lgr;=0.8 for the direct injection system. The excess air ratio (&lgr;) at which net mean effective pressure peaks is thought to be affected mainly by volumetric efficiency, air utilization, and thermal dissociation. In a premix system, as shown in Figure 19, a decline in net mean effective pressure at &lgr;&lt;1 is thought to result from a reduction in the volumetric efficiency of air. Since there is no decline in the volumetric efficiency of air at &lgr;&lt;1 in a direct injection system, we felt that a rich mixture benefiting thermal dissociation and air utilization would obtain peak values. In results, we obtained a 28&percnt; higher output with the direct injection system than the premix system at &lgr;=1, and 35&percnt; higher at &lgr;=0.8. In conversion to direct injection under these conditions, there was likewise no occurrence of abnormal combustion such as backfire and premature ignition, problematic in hydrogen combustion in recipro engines. Figure 23. Mean Effective Pressure vs. Excess Air Ratio (2) Revolution Speed Characteristics Figure 24 shows the relationship of net mean effective pressure to engine revolution speed during wide open operation at the theoretical air/fuel ratio. As shown in Figure 20 on the previous page, the volumetric efficiency of the entire mixture in a direct injection system was highest, exceeding 100&percnt; at revolution speeds of 2,000 rpm and above and approaching 120&percnt; at 6,000 rpm. This indicates that in engines adopting a fuel of a low density gas akin to hydrogen, conversion to direct fuel injection has an output-improving effect akin to that of supercharged systems using turbochargers, etc. That supercharge status is not achieved at 1,000 rpm is laid principally to the fact that air port timing in this engine is designed for high revolutions, and not enough air is taken in at low revolution ranges to achieve supercharging. Thus supercharging may be made possible at all revolution ranges if a variable timing air port is subsequently developed and incorporates timing matched to low revolution ranges. The above-discussed studies showed that volumetric efficiency is increased by conversion to direct injection, and as shown by net mean effective pressure in Figure 24, that wide open output is greatly improved. As a result, the 63&percnt; output of a hydrogen RE with a premix system, as compared to gasoline specifications, was improved to 87&percnt; by a direct injection system, as shown in Figure 25. Figure 24. Mean Effective Pressure vs. Engine Revolution Figure 25. Comparison of Hydrogen Engine Output Performance 4.6 Exhaust Gas Characteristics We ascertained that HC, CO, and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; produced by the combustion of lubricating oil carried into combustion chambers is a nearly constant, extremely low level of 1/100 or less that of gasoline engines regardless of the excess air ratio (&lgr;). Since a similar, dramatic reduction in CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; in particular is impossible as long as gasoline or other fossil fuels are used, this is one of the most valuable benefits of hydrogen engines. Conversely, characteristics similar to those with gasoline engines were revealed for NOx, with an exhaust peak exhibited near &lgr;=1 and sharp reductions on the lean and rich sides, as shown in Figure 26. On the lean side, favorable for heat efficiency, NOx decline to a near zero level soon after an excess air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.6 is exceeded. In typical gasoline engines, a practical operating threshold at these regions due to unstable ignition and combustion, torque variation, and rapid increase in HC and CO exhaust makes operation in lean regions of very low NOx problematic. With hydrogen RE, however, there is no risk whatsoever of increased HC and CO exhaust even in operation at very lean regions, and the experiments described below revealed that stable combustion can be maintained. Figure 26. NOx Exhaust Characteristics The relationship between the excess air ratio (&lgr;) and combustion fluctuation rate was determined and the combustion stability of a hydrogen RE evaluated under operating conditions of 1,500 rpm and Pe=0.1 MPa. Combustion fluctuation rates were determined through calculation by equation (1) using pressure data measured within combustion chambers. CFR=&sgr;Pmax/PmaxM (1) CFR: combustion fluctuation rate &lt;sup&gt; &sgr;&lt;/sup&gt; max: standard deviation of Pmax (350 cycles) PmaxM: mean of Pmax (350 cycles) As shown in Figure 27, the combustion fluctuation ratio increases slightly as the excess air ratio (&lgr;) grows, there is no sudden deterioration as in a gasoline engine, and commercially viable levels are achieved in a range of excess air ratio 1.6 through 5.0. We believe that such ignition and combustion stability in lean regions results from the fact that hydrogen ignites very easily and burns quickly, as shown in Table 1, Basic Properties of Hydrogen. Consequently, vehicles equipped with hydrogen RE allow lean combustion with an excess air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.6 or more over a broad operational range. Results of the above studies indicate that HC, CO and NOx emissions may all be expected to reach very low levels in the emissions of hydrogen RE-equipped vehicles. Figure 28 shows a comparison of NOx exhaust characteristics in a premix and a direct injection system. Peak NOx values were approximately 30&percnt; higher for the premix system, but NOx exhaust was somewhat greater for the direct injection system on the lean side and the rich side, where exhaust quantity was minimal. We believe that this narrowing of differences in NOx exhaust quantity versus excess air ratio (&lgr;) after conversion to direct injection results from increased non-uniformity of the excess air ratio within combustion chambers due to incomplete mixing. Figure 27. Combustion Fluctuation Rate vs. Excess Air Ratio Figure 28. NOx Exhaust Characteristics By Injection System 5. Conclusion Here we summarize the benefits held by RE when hydrogen is adopted as an automobile fuel. (1) RE have a structure suited to hydrogen combustion and allow prevention of abnormal combustion through the mere use of spark plugs with a high heating value for operation at the theoretical air/fuel ratio. (2) Wide open output can be increased 20-30&percnt; by conversion to direct hydrogen injection. A direct injection system hydrogen RE can thereby provide approximately 90&percnt; of gasoline RE output. (3) HC CO, and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; quantities in hydrogen RE emissions are all extremely small. NOx are also minute in lean combustion, and automobiles with quite minimal exhaust can be produced through fine control of the air/fuel ratio during operation. The results of our investigations have shown that fine fuel control, methods for mixing hydrogen and air, and other unrealized improvements to gas fuel for hydrogen RE hold adequate performance for automobile engines supporting a hydrogen-using society of the 21st century.

            "text": "CSO [Article by A. Kishi, Mazda Technical Research Center, Yokohama] [Text] 1. Introduction As the economic recession continues, a social re-examination seems to be taking place with regard to giving consumers the kinds of products and services that they really want. I believe that in times such as this there is more of a demand for authentic products and technologies. What I mean here by authentic is providing a basic value for goods purchased that gives the average customer a sense of satisfaction. To meet these needs requires mature technologies that show an understanding of the consumer and what they want. The mature technologies referred to here are consumer technologies that essentially solve the problems that people consider important to them. For that reason, I think that we are entering a time in which research institutes that have stockpiled many different technologies will be asked to lead the way. Therefore, in this paper, I would like to introduce the Mazda Technical Research Center, and in doing so, discuss what it is doing to address these new social trends. 2. Research Center Profiled The first technical research center that Mazda established to concentrate on new technologies was in 1985 at its headquarters in Hiroshima, and then in 1987, it added the Yokohama Technical Research Center in Yokohama. The basic \"idea\" behind opening the technical research center here in Yokohama was, to use the slogan at the time, \"build an automobile culture.\" What this means is not treating the car simply as a means of travel, but treating it as one of the essential elements of society and culture that people need. When the research centers initially received word of this new slogan, the research center at Mazda headquarters in Hiroshima decided to put its emphasis on new technologies that were directly related to the development of car types, whereas the research center in Yokohama decided it would focus on basic technologies in advanced fields oriented toward automobile technologies of the 21st century. At present, the two research centers are exchanging ideas and deepening ties with one another based on respective areas of expertise, and are steadily playing more important roles as the core places within Mazda for developing new technologies. Next, before we get into specific research activities, I would like to discuss my own views regarding research. 3. Personal Views Regarding Research Research institutes are at the pinnacle of research and development, and have an important mission in developing and exploring consumer technologies. For that reason, I feel that research institutes have to reflect the long-term and medium-term needs of consumers in their research. With that in mind, I would like to take the opportunity here to state the direction I believe that consumer trends are going. Until now, companies have stressed high value-added cars that offer more in the way of diversity, performance, and functionality. In the future, however, there will probably be a shift from superficial \"enjoyment\" needs to more basic \"enjoyment\" needs. The need, for example, to maintain respect for human life, whether one's own or others, is growing ever more stronger in terms of both product safety and the environment. For example, something has to be done about the more than 10,000 people a year that die in auto accidents, and the other problems that exist such as environmental pollution caused by carbon dioxide and nitrous oxides, and also find other energy alternatives to petroleum. These problems are an immediate and future threat to ourselves, our families, and our children, and are cause for concern. These are essentially problems that have to do with the car itself, so if we are to resolve these issues, we must steadily stockpile those technologies with an eye toward the future. With that said, I would now like to introduce some areas of research to show the work we are doing in tackling some of these problems. 4. Research Activities Outlined In this section, I have divided the research activities into \"environment-friendly\" and \"people-friendly\" research, and focused in on particular research projects in each area from the perspective discussed above of addressing the basic needs of today's consumers. 4.1 \"Environment-Friendly\" Technologies What we mean here by \"environment-friendly technologies\" are those technologies for solving the environmental and energy resource problems we are likely to face in the 21st century. More specifically, it means those technologies concerned with developing energy alternatives to petroleum, and those technologies concerned with recycling that try to limit exhaust gas emissions by researching new combustion methods for reducing carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions, and making effective use of resources. (1) Technologies for Developing Energy Substitutes I would like to start by talking about the hydrogen rotary-engine automobile (HR-X). This car was developed to convey the image of an urban-type commuter car to be used in a 21st century environment restored with light and greenery. Figure 1 [figure not reproduced] is a photograph of the HR-X car. A hydrogen rotary engine is a clean engine that burns hydrogen, and is revolutionary in the sense that it does not emit carbon dioxide nor destroy natural cycles. More recently, we developed a prototype model of that car outfitted with a hydrogen fuel cell, and successfully test drove it for the first time. Figure 2 [figure not reproduced] is a photograph of the hydrogen fuel cell car. This car enabled us to clarify a number of technical issues having to do with outfitting a car such as this, and took us one step closer toward achieving the goal of a future society based on hydrogen-fueled cars. (2) Technologies for Controlling Exhaust Gas Emissions In terms of research on engines, we are researching the composition of fuel mixtures and combustion mechanism using a variety of methods including both visual and computer-based. In trying to change the flame propagation process, we have been doing research on a peripheral combustion process that causes the spark ignition to occur from the periphery of the cylinder. Using this technique, we were able to reduce nitrous oxide emissions dramatically, and bring about a major improvement in lean burn combustion. That research received the Asahara Academic Achievement Award at the 42nd Japan Society of Automotive Engineers Conference. (3) Recycling Technologies We are also doing research on materials in terms of recycling, which includes both metals and plastics, and in so doing, have developed a recyclable plastic composite made of a plastic fiber-reinforced liquid crystal polymer. We now have the ability to recycle plastic composites that were once virtually impossible to recycle, and are able to make more effective use of our resources. 4.2 \"People-Friendly\" Technologies What we mean here by \"people-friendly\" technologies are those technologies concerned with understanding the needs of the driver and passengers, and those concerned with improving safety in order to make the automobile society we live in more enjoyable and trouble-free. (1) Preventive Safety We are involved in a number of research projects on advanced technologies concerned with preventing accidents. One of these involves a \"safe driving support system,\" and another a \"road traffic communication system.\" The safe driving support system is a system that acts as a back-up in case of driver error, and the communication system is a system for providing drivers with safety information about the roads. For example, in the safe driving support system project, we are doing research on automatic brakes and a white-line recognition method. In Figure 3 [figure not reproduced], we show the test car we are using in our research on white-line recognition by image processing. Mounted in the trunk of the car is a high-speed computer programmed to recognize road features. (2) Human Technologies We are also making headway in research on a \"driver simulator\" in order to elucidate the driving psychology and behavior characteristics of drivers. In Figure 4, we show a general drawing of the driving simulator with a driver on board. The driving simulator is expected to be used as a tool for elucidating causes of auto accidents, and also as a tool for researching driving characteristics of beginners and older drivers. Figure 4. General Drawing of Driving Simulator We have also been doing research on ways to evaluate driver alertness by measuring brain waves so that we can take those habits into account when designing the inside of the car so as to make it harder for the driver to fall asleep. Figure 5 [figure not reproduced] shows an experiment being conducted to ascertain the relationship between brain wave signals and delayed responses in humans due to decreased alertness (person being tested in photograph is author of article). There are a lot of central functions in the human brain that remain unknown. I think that by creating an understanding of driver characteristics such as recognition, alertness, and fatigue by studying brain activities that we can offer new consumer technologies for improved safety. 5. Conclusion In the foregoing, we profiled the entire research center and discussed some individual research projects. I think that the keys to providing consumers with what they want in terms of basic values are the technologies that we have been busy stockpiling. In introducing the research center from this perspective, we want to thank the many technical engineers and researchers specializing in automobile technology for their help in shedding some light on the research projects being carried out within the center."

            "text": "BFN [As received via ANSASERVICE database] [Text] Rome (ANSA) 7 Feb 94 -- It is absolutely the least polluting automobile engine. The exhaust emissions have been reduced by 90 percent with respect to the normal gasoline engine. We should already be able to see it in operation on delivery vans and buses in two or three years' time, and perhaps also on cars. Hydrogen is the fuel \"of the next century,\" and the hydrogen engine continues to be one of the technological challenges being dealt with by researchers and experts from organizations and universities. In Italy, ENEA [National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment] has built a prototype of this \"green\" engine that is fitted with an \"original\" valve to mix the hydrogen with air. It has been installed on a Fiat \"Ducato\" van that has been \"entrusted\" to the University of Pisa for fine tuning. The system has already provided its first positive results: no carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon, or carbon dioxide emissions. The only pollutants produced are nitrous oxides and these are produced in smaller quantities than by a gasoline engine. \"It is a simple internal combustion engine,\" explains Raffaele Vellone of the ENEA, \"in which the mixing of hydrogen and air must be perfected so that the combinations that give rise to nitrous oxide emissions are limited.\" According to Vellone this objective could be attained in the future. \"Within three years,\" he added, \"in addition to this engine, we will build a prototype `hybrid' vehicle, fueled by hydrogen with `fuel cells' that will give even better results because it will have an electric engine.\" Both systems could produce emissions only slightly in excess of the limits set by American regulations specifying that from 1996 buses should not emit more than 0.25 grams of nitrous oxides per kilometer. In particular the hybrid system with fuel cells could further lower this limit. According to Vellone, this coupling of hydrogen and the electric car could result in zero emissions if the fuel were produced by renewable energy sources. In fact hydrogen can be produced not only from methane but also from methyl alcohol, and biomasses, and by electrolysis starting from clean sources of energy: Hydroelectricity, solar energy, and energy derived from the wind. However, at the current state of the technologies, these systems are still too expensive. The cost of producing a liter of hydrogen can vary from 600 to 1,800 lire, compared with the 400-500 lire of methane and the 1,000 lire of gasoline. It is therefore preferable to produce hydrogen from methane or fossil energy sources. These systems cost less but are more polluting. The cost, however, is not the only \"flaw\" of the hydrogen engine. In fact the limited, though not extremely low, range of the vehicles (150 kilometers for a fully-loaded Fiat Ducato) is also \"worrying\" the ENEA technicians. Furthermore this fuel has a very low density (71 grams per liter compared with the 780 of gasoline) and therefore the tanks take up a lot of space. \"The first concrete applications of fuel cell vehicles,\" said Vellone \"are planned for about the year 2000 and they will be applied to larger vehicles like delivery vans and buses. If the systems are miniaturized then they will also be installed on automobiles.\" Another problem is the lack of hydrogen pipelines for the distribution of the fuel. \"The volatile nature of this fuel,\" added Vellone, \"makes transportation feasible only if the piping is perfectly sealed.\" This problem also concerns other countries. A 200-kilometer experimental version has been built in Germany. Still abroad, in the United States, the gas-hydrogen mixture (the so-called \"hythane\") has been tested and has given positive results in terms of emissions. Although it is not \"green\" like pure hydrogen, this mixture does not create refueling problems because of the high percentage of methane. The recent results of studies conducted by the University of Pisa also confirm that, at present, this is possibly the best solution. However, it can be seen that the hydrogen engine will be most useful for urban transport. Therefore, ENEA advises that the best solution would be a \"dual fuel\" internal combustion engine. In fact the gasoline would be reserved for long journeys, while the hydrogen would be used solely in the city."

According to the group's CEO, Edzard Reuter, the vehicle marks \"a first step toward `ecological mobility,'\" The vehicle's electric engine is not fueled by batteries, but by its own small electrical plant that runs on hydrogen. The hydrogen converts solely into water vapor, which is expelled into the air. Reuter considers the advance significant not only for the automobile industry, but for energy supply in general. Daimler could play an important role in the market for new energies in the future through its knowledge of the new technique. But Hartmut Weule of Daimler's research department stressed that it will take engineers and researchers years of continued testing before the revolutionary model can be mass-manufactured.

            "text": "Cell MI1905075594 Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT in German 14 Apr 94 p 24 MI1905075594 Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT German BFN [Text] Daimler-Benz is looking for an alternative form of energy for the automobile. At its research center in Ulm, the company yesterday presented a vehicle with an electric motor which gets its energy from a fuel cell. Speaking at the company's research center in Ulm, the Chairman, Edzard Reuter, stated that Daimler-Benz AG was well in front of the international field with the car driven by a fuel cell instead of a petrol or diesel engine. The prototype vehicle has already done 2,000 km without any problems. The task now is to reduce the size and weight of the fuel cell by using new materials and technology, and to develop the system at a marketable price. Research Chief, Prof. Hartmut Weule, is confident that this can be done within a period of 20 to 30 years. In addition, Daimler-Benz is continuing the development of electric vehicles with the Zebra battery, a high-performance battery with sodium and nickel chloride. This is one of several possible solutions developed by the Daimler subsidiary AEG. Daimler-Benz runs the fuel cell with methanol from which the hydrogen is obtained in the vehicle. Methanol is produced from natural gas and is a widely available chemical substance. A vehicle could fill up in the normal way from a pump at service stations. The vehicle's range with one tankful matches that of today's vehicles. The advantage of the fuel cell is the greater efficiency of 30 percent compared with 17 to 20 percent of conventional car engines. Hydrogen is generated in the automobile by means of an ion-permeable-polymer electrolyte membrane. The car travels with virtually no harmful exhaust gases, since no nitrogen oxide is produced during cold combustion. The only exhaust gas is water vapor. Consequently, the car already complies with the Californian zero emission requirement. Moreover, only half the amount of carbon monoxide is produced. This alternative form of power is a joint achievement of Dasa and AEG, who developed the project jointly with Daimler's automotive engineering division. Daimler is cooperating with the Canadian company Ballard Power Systems on the development of fuel cells. According to Reuter, \"We have gained an important lead with synergistic effects within the company and in international cooperation.\" Daimler has invested hundreds of millions so far. The technology costs 15,000 German marks per kilowatt of output. Weule thinks there will be numerous potential applications for the fuel cell in the future. It could power railways and ships, provide satellites with electricity, or provide hospitals with an emergency power supply. At present, there are five competing technologies: -- Proton-conducting fuel cells operate at [a temperature ranging] between 20 and 100C, and require hydrogen, which Daimler obtains from methanol; -- Alkaline fuel cells have the greatest efficiency but require pure hydrogen and oxygen; -- Phosphoric acid fuel cells operate with phosphoric acid at 200C and are suitable as decentralized combined heat and power plants; -- Fused carbonate fuel cells requiring temperatures of 650C, are also suitable for coal gas and are likely to come on the market in a few years' time; -- Solid oxide fuel cells are particularly efficient at 1,000C but the high temperatures cause problems. Daimler-Benz is going for the proton-conducting system. The present unit still weighs 800 kg and fills the cargo space of a delivery van. There will be a second version by 1996 which, at one eighth of the size and weighing only 200 kg, will also fit into a passenger car. How Fuel Cells Work Fuel cells convert combustible liquids or gases directly to electricity by electrochemical means with a relatively high efficiency of up to 60 percent. The reaction takes place via hydrogen and oxygen to water. The fuel cell is made of an anode and cathode which are separated by an electron-impermeable electrolyte or a membrane. Pure hydrogen or a hydrogen-containing gas is passed to the anode where the hydrogen molecules are split into ions, and electrons are liberated. These flow via an external conductor to the cathode. At the same time, oxygen from the air is supplied to the cathode. The oxygen takes up electrons and the oxygen ions combine with the hydrogen ions to form water. The hydrogen in the technology presented in Ulm is separated from methyl alcohol. The fuel cells operate silently and without vibrations, and do not develop any environmental pollutants. Various types of fuel cells are being developed all over the world, and some are now undergoing practical tests. Buses powered by phosphoric acid fuel cells are already operational in Vancouver (Canada). Fuel cells do not only provide power for electric cars, however: If designed on a larger scale, they provide an alternative to conventional power stations. Due to their compact, modular design, their output ranges from 50 kW to several megawatts."

Research head Hartmut Weule said in Ulm that the new motor could \"become the greatest innovation for drive technology in the next century.\" The transport vehicle fueled by hydrogen is said to be a \"true zero emission vehicle.\" He said that no exhaust gases were created in driving, nothing but water. However, Daimler-Benz does not think that it will be ready for production for 10 years. In this motor, electrical energy is produced in a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen in so-called \"cold combustion.\" But the size, weight and price of the drive unit are still making problems for Daimler project leader Werner Tillmetz. In the experimental vehicle the 800-kg engine filled the entire load area. In addition, the technology is said to cost 15,000 German marks per kilowatt of power. According to Tillmetz, the next version of the drive, planned for 1996, will only be an eighth as big and weigh 200 kg. Daimler says that the development of the drive has cost them an amount in the hundreds of millions so far.

Compared to a conventional phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC), the maximum electrode output per square centimeter has been upgraded to 1.2 watts. This is approximately four times more than the maximum output generated by a conventional PAFC. Reaction efficiency between hydrogen and oxygen under room temperature has been improved by using high polymer membranes. The company has succeeded in running a commercially available motor scooter using the fuel cell as a mobile power supply. The company is still experimenting with extending the life of fuel cells and plans to conduct joint projects to put the development of this technology to practical use with battery manufacturers and automobile manufacturers. The company miniaturized PEMFC and reduced its weight by applying a high polymer membrane, [naphion], to electrolyte layers in between several layers of cell electrode stacks from which power output is maximized. The amount of platinum used for the fuel cell is 1 milligram per square centimeter of the electrode. The fuel cell drives the motor using 1 liter of hydrogen per minute under atmospheric pressure. In principle, the fuel cell generates electricity resulting from reaction between the hydrogen gas and oxygen in the electrolytes between the catalyst layers and produces water. Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo jointly developed the basic technology with Professor Masahiro Watanabe of the Technology Department of Yamanashi University. The company solved a deterioration problem with catalyst poisoned by carbon monoxide in the hydrogen fuel by developing platinum catalyst to which hydrogen occlusion alloys are applied. Another deterioration problem with the catalyst's function from deterioration of excessive amounts of moisture needed for activating high polymer membranes was solved by replacing a portion of the moisture to electrolytes and then draining another part to achieve the appropriate levels of moisture. The company installed the fuel cell in a 370-watt motor scooter. The company has completed 3000 hours of duration testing and started developing different types of fuel cells with reduced amounts of platinum as an experiment. The company predicts that the development will be commercially available for home-use mobile power supply and non-pollutant automobiles within two to three years. Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo also develops a variety of precision processing technologies for semiconductors and catalysts along with sales of metals. The company's technology development center in Kanagawa Prefecture has been developing catalyst electrodes for fuel cells such as PAFC and recently started expanding its development to fuel cells itself."

            "text": "Show 94FE0277 Tokyo NIKKEI MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY in Japanese Dec 93 pp 52-64--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0277 Tokyo NIKKEI MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY Japanese CSO [Article by Masaaki Maruyama, Kiyotaka Nakanishi, Hiroyuki Ogihara, Toshiyuki Sugiyama, Nikkei Materials and Technology] [Text] Concept cars and elemental technologies exhibited at the 30th Tokyo Motor Show, which was meant to give some idea of automobiles of the near future, proved that the preparation of material technology required for auto manufacturing had been making steady progress. As a result, it was clearer than ever that automobile materials would be the key technology for simultaneously solving the problems of weight reduction, fuel conservation and recycling for automobiles. Effective solutions for the urgent issues of weight reduction and fuel conservation were shown, while steady progress was demonstrated for elemental technologies that seek long-term solutions for the recycling of auto materials, including resins for bumpers. This report concerning the Motor Show consists of two parts: material technology highlights concerning concept cars and elemental technologies shown at the Show are reported in the first part, whereas material utilization trends for future auto manufacturing are compiled in the second part on the basis of interviews with engineers in charge of the material technology departments of auto manufacturers. It appears inevitable that the 1993 production for Japanese automobile manufacturers will have negative growth for the third consecutive year. According to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Inc., the 1992 automobile (four-wheel vehicle) production in Japan was 12.5 million, which was 5.6 percent below the 1991 production, resulting in negative growth for the second consecutive year. In 1993, the probable annual production figure is not expected to reach the 12 million level, and each automaker is struggling to make the production schedule adjustment. Under these severe sales and production conditions, the 30th Tokyo Motor Show was held for 14 days, from 23 October through 5 November 1993, at the Japan Convention Center (Makuhari Messe) in Chiba City, and auto component makers hoped that the Show would spur their sales. Automakers, on the other hand, were concentrating on the exhibit of \"actual cars\" currently on the market, in an attempt to ring up more sales. Although the focus was on the exhibit of the real cars, the Show presented many other interesting items that hinted at what kind of automobiles we could expect in the near future in terms of concept cars and technology. These items uniquely reflected the current times when R&amp;D outlays must be spent effectively, and many of them were still searching for the opportunity to commercialize. Compared with the 29th Tokyo Motor Show of 1991[.sup]1[/] in which several possibilities for near-future technologies had been presented, the 1993 Show had many exhibits that clearly revealed what automaker R&amp;D or Design departments thought to be their first choice for commercialization. Thus, it was easy for a viewer to clearly understand the philosophy and strategy of each auto-manufacturing company. For example, both RAUM of Toyota Motor Corp. and AQ-X of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., were the so-called concept cars with the catch phrase of \"Compact sedans of tomorrow with roomy interior space.\" Nissan explained that AQ-X was created with the same overall length as that of the compact car Primera, the same interior space as that of the luxury-class car President, and the same fuel consumption rate as that of the popular model, Sunny. Both Toyota's and Nissan's concept cars demonstrated how a city-driven, near-future sedan should be made. In the first part of this report, the future material technologies that were incorporated in concept cars and the elemental technologies at the exhibit will be discussed under the three categories of \"Auto Bodies,\" \"Engines,\" and \"Electric Cars.\" Auto Bodies Mazda Adopts Easy-Disassembly Construction, Arranges Various Components in Functional Units Mazda Motor Corp. exhibited the HR-X2, with a rotary engine using hydrogen gas as fuel. The unique features of this concept car included a hydrogen-gas-burning, rotary engine system and a design incorporating both easy-disassembly vehicular construction and outer and inner panels made of a recyclable, \"liquid crystal polymer fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) material.\" Koji Tobita, section chief researcher of the Mazda Technical Research Institute, who oversaw the development of this concept car, says this: \"We developed the HR-X2's body with the idea of making the entire car recyclable.\" The chassis incorporates modular design, and each functional module is unitized. The basic vehicular structure for the HR-X2 has the chassis, the power train (including the engine and the drive mechanism), and the fuel tank arranged together in the so-called under-chassis section, which can be readily separated from the resin-made \"upper body,\" which is located above the under-chassis section. Like the other units, the front functional unit is uniquely designed. The front functional unit consists of head lamps and wipers that are situated below the front cowl for easy removal of a wire harness in disassembly through minimization of electrical wiring, plus an instrument panel guard that incorporates the steering wheel, a shift lever, and an air-conditioner. The rear functional unit is designed in a similar fashion. The unit incorporates a high-mount stoplight, speakers for an audio system, and an air cleaner. In the center console unit, audio equipment and the air-conditioner are controlled by an optically transmitted remote system, and light is reflected on interior mirrors to eliminate interior lights altogether, in order to circumvent the complicated job of removing a wire harness for disassembly. Adoption of Recyclable Liquid Crystal Polymer FRP Among the unique features of the recyclable, easy-to-disassemble auto body construction, perhaps the adoption of a liquid-crystal polymer FRP attracted the most attention from material engineers. The FRP is used for the outer panels, as well as inner panels, of the front hood, both front and rear fenders, the trunk lid, the cab, the doors, and the center console. As a result, according to Mr. Tobita, Mazda expects to be able to recycle \"almost 100 percent of the upper body section.\" At the show, however, Mazda exhibited ordinary glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) outer and inner panels instead. There was only one example of the liquid crystal polymer FRP exhibited among other components, in the form of a test-produced unit combining the rear fender with rear pillars. In 1992, Mazda announced that it had essentially completed the development of this particular liquid crystal FRP, in which a thermoplastic resin is reinforced with microfine liquid crystal polymer fibers. The idea was to reconstitute the reinforcement mechanism of the liquid crystal polymer microfine fibers by remelting a recycled raw material in a pulverized state in the process of injection or compression molding.[.sup]2[/] This time, a \"nylon-based material (PA, or polyamide) was used as the thermoplastic resin to make the liquid crystal polymer FRP.\" Mazda designed the body of the HR-X2 with a lightweight, highly rigid structure using a cross-sectional element of glue-bonded outer and inner liquid crystal polymer FRP panels. This body construction for the HR-X2 was the only change made by Mazda from that of the AZ-1.[.sup]3[/] Another feature of the HR-X2 that drew the attention of the visitors at the Show was its excellent air resistance coefficient, C[.sub]d[/] = 0.3 -- an index of the body's aerodynamic resistance -- despite its bulky, box-like shape. Mazda's explanation was this: \"Air resistance was minimized by dividing the air flow that hits the body into the upper and lower components by means of troughs attached to the sides of the body.\" The trend of reducing a car's fuel cost through the reduction of air resistance is also evident in concept compact cars of other auto companies. For example, Nissan's AQ-X also boasts C[.sub]d[/] = 0.28, and it is equipped with aerodynamic parts, including front and rear aero-bumpers, and a CAE-designed (computer-applied-engineering) underside of the floor to optimize air flow across the underside. Nissan Solves Contact Corrosion Problem of Aluminum/Steel With Aluminum/Steel Cladding The unique feature of Nissan's AQ-X is the adoption of an \"iron-aluminum hybrid body structure\" by using an aluminum alloy for certain structural components and for the outer and inner panels for its doors, front hood, front fenders, and trunk lid. Instead of the aluminum alloy that is not suitable for deep-drawing molding, steel sheets are used for the outer and inner panels of the rear fender which has a severely curved surface. As a result of adopting the iron-aluminum hybrid body structure, the weight of the AQ-X is approximately 20 percent less than that of previous bodies made of steel outer panels. This drastic weight reduction seems to indicate that the adoption of the hybrid structure is expected to meet future auto specifications, since, according to one official, no matter how much a body structure is rationalized, \"the weight of the existing steel body will be reduced only by several percent at best.\" Generally, whenever sheet-steel and aluminum-alloy parts are used together, the joints are attacked by corrosion that results from the contact of dissimilar metals. The corrosion is commonly called \"galvanic corrosion,\" and such joints have to be avoided altogether in auto body construction. Therefore, auto body parts in which aluminum alloys can be used are limited to such parts as front hoods, trunk lids, and hinged parts that function as a lid, such as quickly detachable sun roofs. Otherwise, like the NSX sports car of Honda Motor Co., Ltd., all the body has to be made with an aluminum alloy, with only the smallest area of contact with steel. Nissan solved the problem of contact corrosion between steel and aluminum alloy for the AQ-X by inserting steel/aluminum alloy cladding pieces in the joints. The steel/aluminum alloy cladding pieces are inserted between an aluminum alloy outer panel and a steel inner panel when they are to be spot-welded to form a monocoque body. The aluminum alloy layer of the cladding piece is in direct contact with the aluminum outer panel, and the steel layer of the cladding piece is in direct contact with the steel inner panel, before the entire assembly is spot-welded. As a result, aluminum is welded to aluminum, and steel is welded to steel. As a whole, the aluminum outer panel and the steel inner panel are bonded to each other. Nissan is using the same cold-rolled steel panel SPCD-SPCE as that currently in use and the aluminum-magnesium-based alloy No. 5000, commonly called \"30-30\" (i.e., tensile strength of 300 MPa or 30 kgf/mm[.sup]2[/] and elongation of 30 percent), for the inner and outer panels, respectively. Only one spot-welding voltage is required for spot-welding steel to steel, as well as aluminum to aluminum. Yoshitaka Kurihara, chief researcher at the Vehicular Research Laboratory of Nissan's General Research Institute, says this: \"We chose the ratio of the aluminum alloy to the steel in the cladding material in such a way that one voltage can do both welding jobs simultaneously.\" Cladding materials have two atomic layers of dissimilar metals arranged tightly next to each other, so no air can infiltrate between the two layers; thus, neither oxidation nor reduction takes place. As a result, no potential difference is generated between the steel and aluminum-alloy layers, and that prevents any corrosion process from taking place between the two dissimilar metals. Nissan improved the body rigidity of the AQ-X through both design and material, and, according to Kurihara, \"both bending and twisting rigidity are 20 percent higher than those of previous cars of the same class.\" Nissan successfully prevented any loss of rigidity despite the incorporation of aluminum. The gauge of the aluminum-alloy sheet, like that of previous aluminum-alloy parts, was made 1.4 times that of the sheet steel to maintain the same tensile rigidity as that of a sheet-steel body. The separation of steel from aluminum in an auto body, the critical process in the recycling of cars to be disposed of, was made technically possible by Nissan for the AQ-X. By heating to approximately 500C, \"a brittle intermetallic compound is formed at the interface of the steel and aluminum-alloy layers of the cladding material, which makes it easy to separate the two layers with light impact.\" Nissan believes that the iron-aluminum hybrid body structure is a weight reduction technology with a high probability of implementation, because the advantage of weight reduction can be balanced against the added cost through the optimization of the ratio of cheap sheet-steel to lightweight aluminum alloy. According to Kurihara, as far as the cost problem is concerned, although it is difficult to make a thorough assessment at this time, \"it appears that a certain cost increase is unavoidable.\" Not only does the aluminum alloy cost approximately three times as much as the steel (the ratio of the materials' unit prices x the ratio of the densities), but the production cost is also high for the aluminum alloy, because the spot-welding electrode's life is shorter for the alloy than for steel. Audi Exhibits Space Frame Car With Aluminum Body Germany's Audi Motor Corp. exhibited an Audi Space Frame (ASF) car with a space-frame structure assembled with aluminum-alloy outer and inner panels. Audi plans to use this ASF model for the mass-test-production of the A8, which is to replace the currently sold luxury V8. The A8 is scheduled to be introduced to the German market in May 1994. Although the price of the A8 has not been announced, it has been rumored that the price will exceed the price of the V8 of &yen;11.4 million. It is speculated that the car could afford an all-aluminum-alloy body because of its high-priced status and the moderate production rate of approximately 2,400 vehicles per month. Most of today's passenger cars have a monocoque body that functions as the structural material for outer and inner panels. In contrast, the frame alone of the space-frame structure functions as the structural component for the body, and outer panels are primarily used as the exterior partition. Therefore, the space-frame structure has the advantage of being able to maintain rigidity despite the adoption of materials less rigid than steel, such as aluminum alloys and resin, for the outer and inner panels. Another important advantage of the space-frame structure is that it enables the use of comparatively cheaper extruded materials for the frame structural component. Extruded materials can be made with heavier gauges for use in spots that require high rigidity, or they can be made with thinner gauges for use in spots that require low rigidity. Furthermore, even if sections with insufficient rigidity happen to be constructed in a space-frame structure made of extruded frames, the weakness can easily be compensated for with stiffening ribs. For the space-frame structure of the ASF car exhibited at the show, the lowest-cost extruded material was used in the largest quantity, the next-lowest-cost die-cast material was used in the next-to-largest quantity, and the highest-cost rolled material was used in the smallest quantity. However, based on the concept disclosed in 1991 in which extruded frame materials were to be connected with a die-cast bonding material for the ASF concept model, many observers at the show seemed to get the impression that the use rate of the extruded material was less than previously announced. Audi used an aluminum-manganese-silicon-based alloy for the extruded material, and an aluminum-silicon-manganese-based alloy for the vacuum die-cast material. What attracted the audience's attention is the use of a press-molded rolled sheet material in a complex shape for the part called the \"C pillar\" of the roof section of the ASF car body. The chassis of the ASF car was formed by riveting the roof and panels, such as doors and fenders, that were made by press-molding of aluminum alloy. The panels were riveted, instead of spot-welded to produce bond strength that is higher by approximately 30 percent and to eliminate the anti-production environment element of sparking, which would be caused by welding. Approximately 70 percent of the bonding was done with riveting; the rest was completed by a combination of spot-welding and clinching. The aluminum-alloy materials for the ASF car were supplied by an ALCOA Corp. (U.S.) plant in Germany. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Modifies Rear End With Elastomer Mitsubishi Motors Corp. displayed its concept car, which was a fourth-generation research experimental car -- the HSR-IV. As with the HSR-III of two years ago, Mitsubishi adopted an all-plastic body for the HSR-IV, primarily for weight reduction. The PPE/nylon 6 (polypropylene ether/PA or polyamide) alloy, a thermoplastic resin capable of withstanding an online baking finish temperature (140-160C), was used for vertical outer panels, including fenders; and a sheet molding compound was used for horizontal outer panels, such as the hood, which requires tensile rigidity. Mitsubishi has already developed its body aluminization technology to a level capable of mass-production through the development of the lightweight, experimental SR-17 car. On the other hand, the Material Technology Department of the Passenger Car Development Division said this: \"We again pursued improvement of the resin body, since our resin technology was relatively behind.\" Mitsubishi did not quite solve the problem inherent in plastic bodies -- i.e., \"the usage of a recyclable, thermoplastic resin for horizontal outer panels\" -- with the HSR-IV. Mitsubishi is said to be \"experimenting with a multilayer, thermoplastic resin outer sheet in which a foaming agent is sandwiched between skin layers, in order to increase the sheet gauge to gain sufficient tensile rigidity\" without sacrificing weight reduction. The most unique feature of the HSR-IV was the elastomer \"elastic aero-tail\" that can tailor the shape of the tail-end section to the running conditions in order to modify the aerodynamic environment. Under normal conditions, the tail end is flat. However, under certain running conditions, the tail end rises to form a triangular upheaval, i.e., the upheaval functions as an air spoiler that generates a downward force to counterbalance the buoyancy the car has under high-speed driving conditions. Also, when the car is driven in reverse, the spoiler remains down so as to maintain good rear visibility for the driver. In fact, a similar mechanism had been incorporated in the HSR-III, although, this time, the durability of the elastomer was drastically improved, to the level of ready implementation. At the same time, Mitsubishi improved the design to make the upheaved area smaller. The tail section is covered with a skin-like material of a stretchable, \"special thermoplastic elastomer\" to form an upheaval that is smooth and seamless. Details of this elastomer have not yet been disclosed, although it is said to be \"a styrene-based elastomer with maximum elongation of 600-800 percent.\" The key for the elastomer is the manifestation of the durability for repetitive stretches. A polyolefin-based, thermoplastic resin called TPO -- a blend of polypropylene and ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) -- had been used for the HSR-III,[.sup]1[/] although the resin was not durable enough for the tail section to be commercialized. Sachio Miwa, of the Material Technology Department, says that this time, Mitsubishi, in its experiments, \"achieved an elastomer durability that could cope with 3,000-4,000 repetitive stretches, which is equivalent to the 10 years of use. Therefore,\" he continues, \"it will be possible to commercialize the tail section in the next few years.\" An approximately 100mm-high upheaval can be repeatedly formed on the tail, with a stretch of approximately 300 percent for the elastomer. In contrast to ordinary thermoplastic elastomers, which show a nearly linear elongation-stress relationship, this particular elastomer shows a rubberlike, nonlinear elongation-stress relationship by requiring small stress when stretched by less than 100 percent and then suddenly increasing the stress requirement when elongation exceeds 100 percent. Mitsubishi coated the tail with a urethane elastic paint that could stretch up to 300 percent in order to be able to cope with the elastomer's stretch. According to Miwa, Mitsubishi is \"planning other aerodynamic improvement uses for this elastomer.\" For example, he continues, \"it is possible to have deformable body sections that cover the upper halves of tires, so that excellent aerodynamic conditions are created when moving straight forward; when parts of the tires protrude outside the body in turning situations, the body sections alter their shape to accommodate the tires' protrusion.\" Water-Repelling Windows Under Evaluation by Mitsubishi, Nissan Recently, steady progress has been quietly made in the development of new glass in various auto body components. The progress made in glass development was demonstrated by the water-repelling glass adopted by Mitsubishi and Nissan for the windshields of the HSR-IV and the AQ-X, respectively. The glasses themselves are said to be \"not yet in a fully developed stage.\" Each of the test glasses is being developed jointly by a team of auto and glass makers for improving the windshield visibility on a rainy day. This objective is achieved by coating a glass plate with a water-repelling material to form spherical drops of rainwater on the glass surface to minimize vision distortion. There are two kinds of water-repelling coating material: fluororesin and silicone-based. The problem currently under study is the coating's durability, and, in order to commercialize such a windshield, \"it is absolutely necessary to have the durability of the coating nearly equal to that of the glass itself,\" according to Kenichi Tange, the head of Mitsubishi's Material Technology Department. Since the coating must be made on the outside of the windshield, the coating needs to be resistant to peeling due to various frictions and must be stable against deterioration caused by ultraviolet light. For the HSR-IV, Mitsubishi adopted a new, water-repelling windshield with improved durability in terms of effective water repulsion. According to Mitsubishi, the wear resistance of the new windshield's water-repelling film \"was improved by the addition to the film-coating material of a special agent that undergoes chemical bonding with silica (SiO[.sub]2[/]), the major component of glass.\" Furthermore, Mitsubishi, which had been trying various fluororesin-based coating materials, lowered the molecular weight of the resin specifically for application to the HSR-IV to increase the apparent concentration of fluorine atoms. The higher the fluorine content, the greater the water-repelling effect and the greater the stability against light. Mitsubishi hopes to be able to commercialize the windshield in the next several years. On the other hand, Nissan claims that it is \"in the process of comparative evaluation of fluorine- and silicone-based resins,\" and it has not yet disclosed the latest composition of the coating material. Highly Radio-Wave-Penetrable UV/IR Cut Glass Nissan adopted a UV (ultraviolet) IR (infrared, or heat ray) cut glass for the windows of the AQ-X. This was an attempt to protect the driver and passengers from sunlight and to alleviate the sunlight's heating effect on interior temperature. Another aim will eventually be to lessen the load for the air conditioner. Nissan has not yet disclosed the specifics of the glass surface treatment, although, it explains, a \"metallic micropowder is coated on the interior side of the glass.\" The reason for coating the inside of the glass is to minimize frictions that may promote peeling of the coating material. Although the side window glasses, which may be raised and lowered, are not completely free of interior frictions, Hiroaki Sasaki, an engineer at the Vehicular Research Laboratory of the General Research Institute, says this: \"We believe that the window glass does not require any maintenance work for the sun-screening effect, because this window glass has already achieved a durability that corresponds to the vehicle's durability in terms of number of years.\" The coating of the window glass screens the so-called UV-A light, i.e., ultraviolet light with wavelengths of 400 to 320 nm. Ultraviolet light with wavelengths shorter than 320 nm are either screened out by ordinary glass or unable to reach ground. Therefore, those rays were not included in the targets of the coating. By cutting the transmittance in half, to 30 percent, the coating layer is said to be capable of absorbing more ultraviolet light or UV-A than can ordinary glass, which transmits approximately 60 percent of the rays. However, the screening effect of this coated glass against infrared light has room for further improvement. The IR transmittance of this glass has not yet been divulged, although Nissan claims that \"the transmittance level has been sufficiently reduced.\" Generally speaking, when glass is treated for UV and IR screening, it also tends to reflect more radio waves. For example, in the past, when a rear window glass with a printed antenna was treated for IR screening, the performance of the antenna tended to deteriorate. According to Nissan, \"the new UV/IR cut glass can accommodate a printed antenna because the glass has high radio-wave-penetrability.\" Adoption of Recycled Resin for FRP Bumper Reinforcement Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd. (FHI), came up with an interesting proposal for an exterior part. FHI adopted glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene (GFRP) for reinforcing the bumpers of its concept car, Jasmine, which was developed with the theme of promoting conservation of resources and energy and alleviating traffic jams. The idea also produced a weight reduction effect of the same level as that achieved by the aluminum-alloy bumper reinforcement, which has recently become the mainstream for bumper construction. The choice of the GFRP permits us to decipher FHI's philosophy on resin recycling. The spokesperson from the Design Section of FHI Subaru Technical Headquarters says this: \"Resins have recently been treated badly because of their implications in terms of preservation of the environment. Realistically speaking, however, some parts of the auto body have to be made of resin. In order to be able to recycle resin, some body sections or components must be saved for the use of recycled resin. We want to propose the GFRP bumper reinforcement as one of the most promising components in this category.\" FHI's thinking was that \"the bumper reinforcement, which doesn't need a high-quality appearance, would be the ideal spot to use recycled resin,\" since the reinforcement is hidden behind the bumper fascia. Engines Attracting the most attention at the Engine Exhibit were Nissan's VQ engine, which the developer hopes will become the mainstream engine of the late '90s, and Mazda's rotary engine system, which is designed to be used for hydrogen-burning cars in the future. Significant Weight Reduction Through Abundant Use of Aluminum Alloys for VQ Engine The VQ engine is expected to be installed in ordinary cars as early as 1994. It is a V-type engine with a displacement of 2-3 liters. The engine drew attention because it demonstrated how much weight reduction, fuel-cost reduction, and exhaust cleaning could be improved for the existing gasoline-burning, reciprocating engine. Material technology was fully applied in an attempt to reduce the weight of the engine. Compared with the current VG engine, the weight of the cylinder block was reduced by 29 kg, or 50 percent, in addition to a weight decrease of 5 kg, or 17 percent, in the primary moving system and a total weight decrease of 9 kg, or 19 percent, for the moving valve system plus the cylinder heads. The drastic weight reduction of 50 percent for the cylinder block was achieved through the replacement of the existing cast iron FC with the aluminum alloy ADC 12. The block was molded with a high-pressure die-cast machine installed at Iwaki Plant, Nissan's designated state-of-the-art engine plant. Although the machine is called a die-cast machine, it is a type of high-pressure casting method with a slightly low-casting pressure of approximately 100 MPa. Today, Honda and Mazda are the only automakers that are adopting a high-pressure cast aluminum alloy for cylinder blocks. In 1982, Nissan had adopted a high-pressure cast product for the cylinder block of the 1-liter displacement engine for the then-new model called March. Subsequently, however, Nissan used products (made of aluminum alloys, including AC4B) cast with a low pressure of approximately 1 MPa for cylinder blocks in its campaign for aluminization of large engines. High pressure could not be used for casting, because sand molds had to be used to form the cooling-water passages. This problem was solved for the VQ engine by adopting an open deck-type casting method without using the mold. The cylinder block for the VQ engine had been designed by CAE for rigid construction, as well as for the installation of cooling-water passages. Therefore, according to a spokesperson for the First Power Train Design Department of the Power Train Development Division, although the block \"has an intricate shape for high-pressure casting, the casting method was chosen as a result of optimization with CAE fluid analysis.\" The ADC 12 high-pressure cast product was also used to make the component that unitized the oil pan and the lower crankcase situated under the cylinder block. Unlike previous oil pans that were placed below the cylinder block merely as an attachment, this component also functions as a structural component to increase rigidity of the overall engine. Because of this, an extra effort was made to decrease the weight of the cylinder block. Moreover, the intricately shaped cylinder block was made of a low-pressure cast product from AC4B. The ideal way to reduce the weight of an engine is to reduce the weight of the moving parts of an engine. When parts that undergo reciprocating or rotary motions are made light, not only is less driving energy required, but also the energy loss due to sliding is reduced. In addition, the engine's revolution limit and responsiveness will also increase. Therefore, says Director Kenichi Sasaki, of Nissan, \"the VQ engine was developed as the basic engine model that will be used for the next 15 years.\" Nissan also succeeded in achieving a drastic weight reduction of approximately 20 percent for AC8A-made pistons that were made in a rational shape created via the full use of CAE in stress and heat-flow analyses. Similarly, connecting rods were also made lighter by reducing the diameters of the pins at their smaller ends, which are linked with the pistons. This weight reduction was possible because of the reduction in the piston's weight and because of the improved fatigue strength that resulted from the creation of an appropriate compression stress layer on the rod's surface by hard shot peening. Hydrogen Gas Rotary Car Achieves 230-km Cruising Distance For the last several years, Mazda has been energetically developing a near-future engine in the form of a hydrogen-gas rotary engine for low-pollution vehicles. The engine at the show drew much attention because it may soon be used in combination with an improved version of today's gasoline-reciprocating engines if low-pollution cars are required to meet exhaust-emission regulations of the state of California, in the United States. Mazda's HR-X2 concept car, which carries the rotary engine (displacement of 2 x 654 cc), achieved a cruising distance of 230 km at a constant speed of 60 km/h with 43 m[.sup]3[/] [normal] of hydrogen gas stored in a fuel tank, which contained a hydrogen-occluded alloy. The mass of this hydrogen-occluded alloy-containing fuel tank is approximately 300 kg, which is about the same as that of a battery for an electric vehicle. However, according to Director Takanori Minami, \"the hydrogen-gas rotary engine car has the edge over the electric vehicle because the cruising distance for the former is twice that of the 100 km or so for the latter.\" The hydrogen-occluded alloy is a misch metal/nickel alloy (MmNi[.sub]5[/], Mm is a mixture of rare earth metals). This alloy, which weighs 18 kg, is packed in a thin, long cell with dimensions of approximately 11x7x68 cm. Arranged inside the cell with a grid-like cross-section are fins made of extruded No. 5000 aluminum alloy. Thin pipes for circulating warm and cold water are installed at the intersections of the grid formation. Both ends of the cells are welded together by tungsten-inert gas welding to form a tank. The hydrogen-occluded alloy is heated or cooled by water or cold water, using the engine's cooling water, for the desorption or absorption of hydrogen gas. A total of 18 cells makes up the tank (with the total weight of the alloy being 250 kg), which is located on the trunk floor. The rotary engine mounted in the HR-X2 is an improved model of the 13B base. The new engine has a higher output as a result of a change in the intake process: instead of the simultaneous intake of both air and hydrogen, as in the old engine, hydrogen gas is injected into the combustion chamber after air has been led into it from a separate port. Mazda is \"proud of the new engine's performance level, which is equal to that of the existing gasoline reciprocating engine,\" with a maximum output-maximum torque of approximately 96,000 W/170 N/m (130 PS/17.0 kgf/m). Elsewhere, FHI's cylinder sleeve made of an aluminum alloy with excellent wear resistance and machinability was also worthy of attention. This aluminum alloy was 3HA with a composition of Al-14 weight-percent Si, a product of Australia's Comalco Ltd. The unique feature of this alloy is the superfine size of precipitated intermetallic compound grains, 10 m. Electric Vehicles At the show, electric vehicle makers exhibited low-pollution cars to show their concern for the environment and appeared to demonstrate the philosophy that cars of the near future should be made differently from current, gasoline-burning, reciprocating engine cars. Exhibited at the show were a multitude of electric vehicles, including Toyota's EV-50 and Nissan's (Abeniiru) EV, representing low-pollution vehicles of the near future. One of the factors that have been pushing automakers into the development of these electric vehicles is the auto emission regulations of the state of California (U.S.) that, starting in 1994, mandate the step-by-step introduction of low-pollution vehicles. According to the regulations, which are the strictest in the world, 2 percent of the total number of vehicles to be sold must, starting in 1998, consist of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) that emit no nonmethane-based organic gas in exhaust. A Toyota official says that low-pollution vehicles emerged in force because \"it will soon be 1998, and we don't have much time to evaluate the vehicle's reliability and durability.\" A spokesperson at Honda Technical Research Institute says this: \"Today, it is the time for us to tell everybody how far we have come along technically and how technology can be applied to low-pollution vehicles.\" Today, two types of low-pollution vehicles have been proposed: one is an electric automobile that gets its motive power from a motor driven by electricity stored in a battery, and the other is a hybrid car that is equipped with an internal combustion engine to supplement the battery power, so it can run with larger output and for a longer cruising distance than the electric automobile. From the standpoint of practicality, both types require the further development of an efficient battery and a motor. At this show, displayed batteries were noteworthy for the fact that they seemed to need much further improvement. Sodium-Sulfur Battery With High Energy Density Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. exhibited the EE-10, which was developed within the concept of the \"lightweight, hybrid city commuter.\" Intended for city driving, this car normally runs on electricity, as well as on a 660-cc methanol engine for high-speed, long-distance driving. According to its specifications, this car was equipped with a sodium-sulfur battery that was under joint development by Yuasa Battery Co., Ltd. (Yuasa) (Tokyo) This battery is unique in that it has the highest energy density of all the electric car batteries currently commercialized or under development. The energy density is an index for cruising distance per charging: the greater the energy density, the greater the distance the car can travel without further charging of the battery. As of now, the energy density of a sodium-sulfur battery is 100 Wh/kg, approximately 2.5 times that of a lead battery. Theoretically, a sodium-sulfur battery can attain an energy density that is \"about 10 times that of a lead battery,\" according to a spokesperson at Yuasa's Tokyo Development Laboratory. Moreover, the output density of a sodium-sulfur battery -- which indicates a car's acceleration capability, hill-climbing capability, and maximum speed -- is 150 W/kg, and its charging life (the number of tolerable times for repeating charging and discharging) is 1,000 times. Both of these numbers are comparable with those of a lead battery. The sodium-sulfur battery with the above-described, excellent performance is constructed like a sandwich rolled into a cylindrical form, with a solid electrolyte of _b_-alumina (_b_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]) between the sodium plate anode and the sodium-sulfur (Na[.sub]2[/]S[.sub]x[/]) plate cathode. It is claimed that the battery \"converts energy at 100-percent efficiency, because no side reactions occur\" in the battery's electrochemical process. This battery has the advantage of undergoing no self-discharge and being made of materials that come from abundant resources. On the other hand, it is not easy to handle. According to the Fire Service Law, sodium and sulfur, which are used for the electrodes, are classified under category 3, \"spontaneously ignitable and water-prohibitive substances,\" and category 2, \"combustible solids,\" respectively. Their uses are restricted in that registration with the Fire Defense Agency is required when more than a given quantity of either of the two materials is handled. In fact, a sodium-sulfur battery was not installed in the EE-10 at the show. The Fire Service Law prohibited the battery from being brought into the exhibition hall. In addition to that problem, technical problems still remain with the sodium-sulfur battery. For example, because of its high operating temperature of above 300C, the battery needs to be heated for charging and needs to be protected from cooling while the car is being driven. To solve this temperature problem, it will be necessary to develop a heat-insulating vessel and a heating mechanism that does not interfere with the high energy density, i.e., the low weight, of the sodium-sulfur battery. According to the Design Department of Suzuki, \"sodium-sulfur battery development has just begun. From the standpoint of resources, we expect more from this battery than from the nickel-based battery, and it will eventually replace the lead battery.\" Long-Life Nickel-Hydrogen Battery; ZEV-Favorite Lead Battery The \"nickel-based battery\" is the general name for a group of batteries that use nickel for the cathode. There are four types of nickel-based battery, depending on the composition of the anode: cadmium, iron, zinc, and hydrogen-occluded alloys (including LaNi[.sub]5[/]). Of those, automakers appear to be staying away from Niccad batteries, which used cadmium for the anode, because of the metal's toxicity. Of the remaining three, the nickel-hydrogen-occluded alloy (nickel-hydrogen) battery is currently in the position closest to commercialization, because of its excellent balance between energy density, output density, and long life. For example, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd. mounted a nickel-hydrogen battery in its hybrid car EV Sedan, which has a maximum speed of 120 km/h and a cruising distance of 450 km. Although details of components of the battery, including the hydrogen-occluded alloy, have not been disclosed, its performance reportedly includes an energy density of 65 Wh/kg, which is 1.5-2 times that of the lead battery, and an output density of 170 W/kg, which is 1.5 times that of the lead battery. Most remarkable is the battery's life, which is said to be \"as durable as the car itself, even with daily repetition of charging and discharging.\" Honda also exhibited a nickel-hydrogen battery, which had been developed jointly with Matsushita Battery Co., Ltd. (Moriguchi City, Osaka Prefecture), and Ovonic Battery Corp., a U.S. battery maker. This battery's energy density and output density are approximately 60 Wh/kg and 170 W/kg, respectively, which are about the same as those for Daihatsu's battery. According to Honda's Tochigi Research Institute, however, \"the battery's life is currently good for only 500 cycles of charging and discharging, which we intend to extend to the car's life.\" Tochigi Research Institute also says this: \"It should take several more years before this battery can be mass-produced.\" Honda needs to ensure that the excellent performance of a single cell will not deteriorate when cells are combined to form a module. Furthermore, before the nickel-hydrogen battery can be commercialized, \"the recovery and re-use technologies for hydrogen-occluded alloys must be established,\" according to Tokyo Development Laboratory, Yuasa, and something must be done to bring the cost down from what is now approximately 15 times that of the lead battery. Still, many problems need to be solved for both sodium-sulfur and nickel-hydrogen batteries. Automakers, particularly Nissan and Honda, seem to have the opinion that \"lead batteries are suitable for ZEVs from the standpoint of reliability, safety, ease of handling and cost, and nickel-based batteries need to be developed primarily for the post-ZEV future.\" Both the EVX -- which Honda is thinking of commercializing in the future -- and the (Abeniiru) EV -- for which Nissan is planning limited sales -- carry a lead battery. A spokesperson from the Third Development Center in Toyota says that \"for the time being, our main effort will be focused on performance improvement for lead batteries, such as low-temperature performance and life\" for electric vehicles. Low-pollution vehicles, including electric and hybrid cars, that use a battery as the source of energy generally cost two to five times more than existing cars. According to Nissan's Technical Vehicle Development Laboratory, in order to reduce the cost of an electric car, \"it is critical to lower the cost of its exclusive components in addition to the batteries.\" At the same time, it may also be necessary to further develop the heretofore nurtured weight reduction technology, so that the battery's weight can be easily dealt with in the context of the reduced weight of the vehicle. Hybrid Electric Car Charges Battery While in Motion Mitsubishi showed off its hybrid electric car, the ESR, for its low fuel consumption and low pollution. This electric car carries a compact generator operated by a gasoline engine for the purpose of charging the battery. When the battery is sufficiently charged, the car is driven by currents from the battery. However, when the capacity of the battery becomes low, the generator is actuated to charge the battery without the car stopping. This is called the series hybrid method, for \"hybrid-operating\" the car while its battery is being charged. The engine for driving the generator is driven at a constant revolution that is extremely efficient and generates the least emission per output. The idea behind the development of the ESR was that, \"by installing the generator as the power source, less transmission loss can be encountered than with power transmitted from a thermal power plant. Therefore, from the overall standpoint, less fossil fuel is consumed and less carbon dioxide is generated.\" Based on that idea, minimization of energy loss was stressed throughout the development of the ESR, including the design of its body and electric components. For example, in order to increase the efficiencies of the motor and the generator, silicon steel plates that were 0.25-0.3mm thick and had only recently been placed on the market were used for their core sections. Those plates can reduce eddy current loss, because they are 0.5mm thinner than the existing plates. It is claimed that \"the motor's efficiency improved by 2 percent merely by reducing the plate thickness from 0.5mm to 0.25mm.\" References 1.

            "text": "NHTSA believes that the same considerations that apply to alcohol dual fueled vehicles also apply to ones fueled by other liquids. The agency is unaware of any other potentially available liquid alternative fuels that would have a significantly higher energy content than alcohol on a volume basis. Assuming that other liquid alternative fuels do not have a significantly higher energy content, a driving range greater than 200 miles for dual fueled passenger automobiles using any liquid fuel could necessitate redesign of the vehicles to accommodate a larger fuel tank. The agency requests comments on whether there are any potentially available liquid alternative fuels that do have a significantly higher energy content than alcohol on a volume basis, and, if so, whether a driving range higher than 200 miles should be set for such fuels. Depending on the comments, the agency may set a higher driving range for such vehicles. The above discussion assumes that the same fuel tank could be used for both the alternative liquid fuel and gasoline, as is the case for alcohol dual fueled vehicles. If a separate fuel tank were required for the alternative liquid fuel, the limited available space in a passenger automobile for such an additional tank would be an even more critical reason not to set the minimum driving range above 200 miles. Gaseous fuels always require a separate fuel tank from gasoline or diesel fuel. In the previous rulemaking concerning minimum driving range, the agency's concerns about the limited available space in a passenger automobile for additional fuel tanks led it to establish a 100 mile minimum driving range for natural gas dual fueled vehicles. Given the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act, NHTSA has tentatively concluded that the minimum driving range for these vehicles should be increased to 200 miles. As discussed above, the agency cannot set a lower minimum driving range for these vehicles. Moreover, NHTSA believes that the minimum range should not be greater than 200 miles because such a range could discourage manufacturers from producing natural gas dual fueled vehicles, given the limited available space for additional fuel tanks. The agency notes that the concerns it expressed in 1990 about a driving range greater than 100 miles for these vehicles would be of even greater significance for ranges above 200 miles. The same considerations that apply to natural gas dual fueled vehicles also apply to dual fueled vehicles using other gaseous fuels, since all of these vehicles require a separate fuel tank from gasoline or diesel fuel. Therefore, the agency is proposing to establish a 200 mile driving range for these vehicles as well. B. Proposed Gallon Equivalents for Gaseous Fuels In order to carry out the special procedures for fuel economy calculations that apply to alternative fuel vehicles, it is necessary, for gaseous fuel vehicles, to have a gallons equivalent measurement. The 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act specified that 100 cubic feet of natural gas is deemed to contain 0.823 gallon equivalent of gasoline. The 1992 amendments required NHTSA to determine the appropriate gallons equivalent measurement for gaseous fuels other than natural gas, and a gallon equivalent of such gaseous fuel shall be considered to have a fuel content of 15 one-hundredths of a gallon of fuel. As part of determining appropriate gallons equivalent measurements for gaseous fuels, NHTSA consulted with the Department of Energy (DOE) Fuels Utilization Data and Analysis Division. NHTSA and DOE agreed that the following gaseous fuels could be potential transportation fuels by 2008: liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and hydrogen. Pursuant to a contract with DOE, Abacus Technology Corporation prepared a report titled ``Energy Equivalent Values of Three Alternative Fuels: Liquefied Natural Gas, Liquefied Petroleum Gas, and Hydrogen.'' This report is available for review at the docket number cited in the heading of this notice. The Abacus report develops gallons equivalent measurements for LNG, LPG, and hydrogen gaseous fuels. After reviewing the Abacus report, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Mobile Sources recommended adding hythane fuel (a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas (principally methane)) as a gaseous fuel for which a gallon equivalent should be calculated. EPA stated that although hythane is currently being used and evaluated on a limited basis, there is a possibility that hythane fuel may become commercially available as a gaseous fuel. In a follow-up report, which is also available in the docket, Abacus developed an appropriate gallon equivalent measurement for hythane. NHTSA notes that Abacus recommended using lower heating values for deriving the gallons equivalent measurements for gaseous fuels because this value represents the energy available from combustion in an engine. 1. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) The first Abacus report noted that the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 included natural gas as an alternative fuel, but did not specify its physical state as a compressed gas or a liquefied gas. The report assumed that the Act was referring to compressed natural gas, which was the more familiar technology when the Act was passed. The Abacus report recommended that the same 0.823 gallon equivalent of natural gas established in the Alternative Motor Fuels Act be applied to LNG based on energy content in British Thermal Unit (BTU)/Standard Cubic Feet (SCF), because LNG composition and heat of combustion are similar to compressed natural gas. 2. Liquefied Propane Gas (LPG) The Gas Processors Association Standard 2140&hyph;92 specifies four grades of LPG. They are commercial propane, commercial butane, commercial butane-propane mixtures, and propane HD&hyph;5. Propane HD&hyph;5 is recognized as the most suitable fuel for internal combustion engines operating at moderate to high engine severity. The Abacus report concluded that one gallon of LPG, grade HD&hyph;5, is equivalent to 0.732 gallon of gasoline, using a lower heating value."

            "text": "3. Hydrogen The Abacus report concluded that the gallon equivalent of 100 SCF of hydrogen is 0.240, using a lower heating value. 4. Hythane Hythane is a combination of two gaseous fuels: hydrogen and natural gas. Most of the experimental engine work involves the mixtures of 85 volume percent natural gas and 15 volume percent hydrogen (Hy5). The maximum concentration of hydrogen that can be used without potentially causing engine problems, such as backfiring, is 15 percent (5 percent energy content). The second Abacus report concluded that the gallon equivalent of 100 SCF of this hythane mixture is 0.725 using the lower heating value. NHTSA is proposing to adopt the gallons equivalent measurements for LNG, LPG, hydrogen, and hythane recommended by the Abacus reports. The agency requests comments on the methodology used to determine the proposed gallons equivalent measurements. NHTSA also requests comments on whether any other gaseous fuel may potentially be used in automobiles in the foreseeable future, and thus, whether gallons equivalents for any other gaseous fuels should be established. NHTSA plans to add the gallons equivalent measurements to Part 538. The agency is proposing a new name for this part to reflect its expanded scope. Regulatory Impacts A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action and has determined that the action is not ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. In this NPRM, the agency proposes to set the minimum driving range for all dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles at 200 miles and to establish gallon equivalents for specified gaseous fuels. None of the proposed changes will result in an additional burden on manufacturers. They would not impose any mandatory requirements but would instead implement statutory incentives to encourage the manufacture of alternative fuel vehicles. For these reasons, NHTSA believes that any impacts on manufacturers will be so minimal as not to warrant preparation of a full regulatory evaluation. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The agency has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this proposed rule, if made final, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rationale for this certification is that, to the extent that any passenger automobile manufacturers qualify as small entities, their number would not be substantial. Moreover, conversion of vehicles to dual fuel status with the minimum ranges that would be established by this regulation would be voluntarily undertaken in order to achieve beneficial CAFE treatment of those vehicles. Therefore, no significant costs would be imposed on any manufacturers or other small entities. C. National Environmental Policy Act The agency has also analyzed this rule for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act, and determined that it would not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Increased evaporative emissions due to added fuel volume would be the most important environmental impact of this rulemaking if it induced manufacturers to enlarge the size of existing fuel tanks in order to produce dual fuel vehicles operating on alcohol or other liquid fuel. However, the proposed minimum range would not make it necessary for these dual fuel vehicles to have enlarged fuel tanks. Natural gas and other gaseous dual fueled automobiles will not expect to increase evaporative emissions since gaseous tanks do not normally vent to the atmosphere. D. Paperwork Reduction Act The procedures in this proposed rule for passenger automobile manufacturers to petition for lower driving ranges are considered to be information collection requirements as that term is defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 5 CFR part 1320. The information collection requirements for part 538 have been submitted to and approved by the OMB, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .) This collection of information has been assigned OMB Control No. 2127&hyph;0554. (Minimum Driving Ranges for Dual Energy Passenger Automobiles) and has been approved for use through June 30, 1996. E. Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. F. Civil Justice Reform This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect and it does not preempt any State law. 49 U.S.C. 32909 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of automobile fuel economy regulations. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. Public Comments NHTSA solicits public comments on the issues presented in this notice. It is requested, but not required, that 10 copies be submitted."

            "text": "Language: French Article Type:CSO [Article by Jean-Francois Augereau: \"Europe Reaches an Agreement on Manned Flights\"] [Text] Eventually, it took the Europeans over one year after their Granada (Spain) meeting of November 1992, to reach an agreement on their manned space flight policy. Following several postponements, in October and December 1993, representatives of ESA (European Space Agency) member states agreed on Tuesday 18 January, after a marathon negotiation. The Europeans decided to provide preliminary financing over the next two years for the MSTP (Manned Space Transportation Program) supported by the French (up to 107 million accounting units[.sup]1[/]) and for the Columbus program pushed by the Germans (270 million accounting units). The Europeans will meet again in mid-1995 to decide whether or not to proceed with these programs. The first of these programs, the cost to completion of which was estimated last September at a little under 2 billion accounting units, aims to service orbital space stations with two vehicles: the CTV (Crew Transport Vehicle), a sort of large capsule capable of carrying men and equipment; and the ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle), an intelligent service module required for setting manned modules and capsules into orbit and for their rendezvous operations. According to the ESA, the second flight of the new European Ariane-5 launcher, in 1996, might provide an opportunity to launch a sort of unmanned pre-CTV. The second program, Columbus, has an estimated cost of 2.3 billion accounting units; it will involve building a manned module, the APM (Attached Pressurized Module), which is becoming less ambitious as time and budgets go by and should one day be added to the future international space station concocted by the Americans and the Russians, soon to be joined by the Europeans and the Japanese. The ESA council decided to implement an \"Act in council\" that should soon bring the MSTP and Columbus programs under a single banner, making it easier to negotiate with manufacturers and to join forces for the negotiations with Moscow and Washington. Footnotes 1. One accounting unit is worth about 7 French francs."

Adapt Strategy to Changed Conditions. Stronger Involvement of Small and Medium-Sized Companies. German Astronautics Must Not Jeopardize Its Great Potential\"] [Text] Thursday, 11 Nov 93 (HANDELSBLATT)--\"As long as our competitors are being government-supported in a world of international competition, this has to be possible in Germany too. As with all high technologies, with space too the government has to not only set the general framework, but also provide positive support for further development.\" The new director general of DARA (German Agency for Space Affairs), Jan-Baldem Mennicken, made this statement in a conversation with HANDELSBLATT. In Mennicken's opinion, German astronautics is contributing to the solution of terrestrial problems. This refers first and foremost to problems of telecommunications, earth observation, navigation and detection and ranging. It is making use of fixed positions beyond the earth. Besides direct practical application, DARA is interested also in the (indirect) economic effect of space projects, in improvement of the industrial structure. It is precisely small and medium-sized companies too that must be included in the programs here: On the one hand, large companies must let themselves be supplied by small and medium-sized ones. Mennicken: \"We want to bring about transparency in the market as regards national funds and those of the European Space Agency (ESA) as well. We are trying to get the large system companies to deliberately award a part of their contracts to small and medium-sized companies.\" On the other hand, DARA is trying to make small and medium-sized companies fit for such industrial cooperation, including for development, as regards reliability and quality standards, for example. DARA has worked out a strategic plan for this purpose. There have definitely been successes in the endeavor of the \"commercialization\" of German astronautics--meaning economic activities independently of government support. According to the German industry's data, space's share in 1992 already reached a volume of business of 430 million German marks [DM], primarily in the area of telecommunications and through contracts associated with the production of ESA's Ariane-4 rocket. DM1.248 billion of government support funds were received in the same time period, it is stated. The one-to-three ratio between both sources of income is viewed as relatively satisfactory. Research Funds Not Only from BMFT [Federal Ministry for Research and Technology] Ever since its founding DARA has endeavored to interest in space projects other departments too, besides the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT) as the main financier of German aerospace. There have already been successes here too. For instance, a decision has been made at the Federal Ministry of Transport to appropriate funds for the second generation of Meteosat weather observation satellites that will be operational around the year 2000. The time lead versus purely terrestrial weather observation already today amounts to two days. Cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture is desired in a special application for monitoring the use of agricultural areas. The observation of seismic areas is very valuable to the insurance business, for example. The German Rosat x-ray satellite has provided spectacular results in space-station-based astronomy. It is essential for full utilization of the potential for the exploitation of space to develop certain additional instruments or to find a new use for instruments at hand. According to Mennicken, the Europeans' participation within ESA-- essentially cofinanced by the Germans--in the international but American-dominated Freedom space station has to be redefined. For, after the turn of events in the East and for budget reasons, the Americans decided on close cooperation with the Russians. A flight of the US Space Shuttle to the Russian Mir space station, where the Americans want to dock, is planned at present. In addition, a \"core station\" is to be built from American and Russian components in 1997-98. The large Freedom space station is still the ultimate goal. By the way, the Japanese have decided on a stay in this ambitious project. Furthermore, the Canadians too are one of the party with their robotic arm that they designed. The Europeans have had to order substantial economizing in their Columbus contribution--likewise for budget reasons. For instance, the MTFF (Man Tended Free Flyer), i.e., a docked laboratory module, has been shelved. Using the new Ariane-5 rocket as a transporter for cargo and later for people is being discussed now, instead of the canceled Hermes space transporter. On the other hand the Polar Platform scheduled for orbiting over both poles of the earth will come about. It is planned as a carrier for the new large Envisat satellites. The Europeans (ESA) demanded active participation in the (to be reconfigured) Russian-American space station. They would like to provide a data management system or a special antenna for communication between satellites, for example. After the two space shuttle missions under German scientific leadership--D1 and D2--there will be no D3. This is an obvious political decision, says Mennicken. Just whether there will be a Europe-1 mission within ESA is still being debated at present. The hypersonic transporter project, along the lines of the Sanger (Germany) or Hotol (Great Britain) proposals, at the interface of aeronautics and astronautics, also had to be revised in its basic formulation nationally or within ESA, \"in order to be able to decide in 10 or 20 years on the development of prototypes.\" Mennicken joins with the call of the Federal Association of the German Aerospace and Armaments Industry (BDLI) to absolutely maintain a certain industrial base in order to be able to still take part at all as a partner country in international projects. There is a threshold that, if fallen below, has to result in a loss of know-how and of valuable staff members. This holds true all the more so when the USA together with the Russians has definitely decided to further pursue manned space flights too. Lunar Station Is Being Debated As Ever The Japanese are going all out in space today after years of a certain reservedness. The (unmanned) Russian Mars mission is pending in 1994 and 1996. Three US shuttles have also come of age up to the Challenger replacement, the Endeavour. According to NASA's account, plans for a successor transport system cannot be financed at present. According to the head of DARA, a lunar station--which was previously one of the visions of the German rocket pioneer and father of the Saturn-5 lunar rocket, Wernher von Braun--is for the time being not topical. However, ESA is forming a strategy group of space specialists, bankers and industrialists that is to examine this aspect. Mennicken also mentions visions of space experts at Deutsche Aerospace AG [German Stock Corporation]. According to them, in cooperation with the Russians sometime in the future, helium-3, which occurs in practically unlimited quantities on the moon, could be \"surface-mined,\" transported to the earth and be used here to produce energy in \"clean,\" i.e., non-radiating, fusion reactors. A second vision boils down to the solution of the ozone hole problem. The use of laser beams in order to form ozone is one of the possibilities to be investigated here. Whether these visions can ever be realized cannot be answered at present. But the head of DARA considers it important to inspire young people toward new ideas henceforth also. At any rate part of the impetus of the last 30 years owes itself to this enthusiasm. DM1.737 billion have been appropriated as the total sum for space for fiscal year 1993 (German contribution to ESA, funds for the national space program including the bilateral project, as well as funds for the German Research Institute for Aerospace (DLR)). The head of DARA considers this amount \"still considerable considering the problems in this country. Our job will be to focus on priorities the funds available.\" Additional potential for the exploitation of space must always to be paid attention to. We have to investigate, for example, \"whether we should proceed via satellite technology in the further development of telecommunications.\" There are particularly very good capabilities for astronautics in Germany with its industrial infrastructure and with DLR's research and testing centers, he says."

            "text": "Language: German Article Type:CSO [Article by Wolfgang Engelhardt: \"ESA Budget Shrinks Still Further\"first paragraph is FLUG REVUE introduction] [TEXT] During his visit to Jena-Optronik, European Space Agency (ESA) Director General Jean-Marie Luton announced the latest developments regarding the ESA budget. The extent of ESA participation in a space station project will not be decided until 1995. Primarily in response to pressure by Germany and Italy, the ESA will further reduce its already curtailed plans for manned space projects. The budget proposal recently submitted by ESA Director General Jean-Marie Luton, which would have totaled approximately 35 billion German marks [DM] by the year 2000, will be subjected to further cuts. This latest budget estimate already incorporated the elimination of DM7.5 billion from the long-term budget agreed upon in Grenada only a year ago. Now it appears that the DM5.3 billion ceiling placed on the 1994 ESA budget was too high. The worldwide recession has hit the ESA member states as well; furthermore, Germany is struggling with the cost of unification. Further reductions in the research budget and in the German contributions to the ESA are inevitable. Luton plans to submit a new budget proposal in mid-December. This is likely to include additional cutbacks in manned space projects in particular. For example, it is doubtful whether the recently announced projects for a scaled down space station module, the astronaut capsule, and a transport vehicle will be able to be developed simultaneously, as was planned. It will be impossible to determine what is important technologically until the negotiations between the National Space Agency (NASA) and Russia concerning the space station are closer to being finalized. Given the Russian surplus in space station components, the construction of a European laboratory module for the Alpha Station, as it is presently called, may no longer make as much sense. This could revive plans by the ESA for a new astronaut capsule with high load capacity. This capsule would be capable of placing American and Russian as well as European astronauts, together with their equipment, into orbit around the Earth. This \"Crew Transport Vehicle\" could also serve as a rescue vehicle. Europe could also provide a strong, reliable carrier in the form of the Ariane-5 rocket, the development of which is near completion. The Ariane 5 can transport a capsule carrying four pilots and a 400 kg payload into orbit, even at an equatorial axis of 52 degrees, as is currently being considered for the international space station. By no means is the ESA willing to relinquish its long-term objective of participating in the space station project. According to Luton, the organization is still hoping for a substantial German contribution. The ESA Council will continue its discussion of future ESA participation in the European space station project in mid-December, taking in account the most recent results of the American-Russian talks. However, the final decision on the construction of a space station module and/or the astronaut capsule will not be made until the executive council meeting, which is to take place in the spring of 1995. While in Jena, Luton checked into the productivity of the local optoelectronic firms, which would like to play a larger role in European space projects. He indicated that he was impressed by the technical caliber of Jena Optronik as well as by the commitment and skill of its approximately 100 workers. Luton will attempt to see to it that the newly organized aerospace plants in the new laender, with their experienced personnel, receive more ESA contracts. This is extremely important, as the few research contracts awarded by the ESA to eastern German firms in 1993 totaled only DM1 million. This figure could reach as high as DM25 million in 1994 if all the bids from Jena to produce optoelectronics components for several ESA satellite projects are accepted. These include the so-called Omos Ozone Telescope for the Envisat Environmental Satellite (DM6 million) as well as various components for the planned European XMM X-ray Satellite. In the past, the technicians and scientists of the \"VEB Carl Zeiss Jena\" produced their cameras and sensors exclusively for Russian space projects, but with the breakup of the Soviet Union, this market has dried up. New the four reorganized and drastically \"trimmed\" parts firms with their high-quality products must find new markets and customers. Both the German Space Agency (DARA) and Deutsche Aerospace have jumped on the bandwagon and invested heavily in Jena."

            "text": "Language: English Article Type:CSO [Article by Norri Kageki] [Text] Tanegashima--After a decade of development marred by two engine explosions, one fatality and a long lift-off delay, Japan launched its H-II rocket last week, a 260-ton declaration of independence from U.S. aerospace technology. The blast-off of the 50-meter-high, &yen;270 billion ($2.45 billion) rocket--the first such space vehicle entirely made in Japan--brought with it a medley of cheers and sighs of relief. Pressure on the 800 engineers engaged in the operation, already intense due to a two-year-long delay, was heightened by last month's failure of a European Arianespace rocket in French Guiana. ``Japan has finally completed a means of transportation in space that we can use at our free will,'' said Kenji Seyama, director of the Space Development Division at the Science and Technology Agency. Yet the scientific achievement by the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) won't erase doubts that the satellite-launching business, from which the rocket could help to pay for itself, is already saturated worldwide. Number 5 After all, Japan is merely taking its place behind four other nations in the ranks of space superpowers--the U.S., Russia, the European Arianespace consortium and China. Japan has developed three major rockets over the past 30 years, but each relied heavily on U.S. technology, and Washington placed restrictions on their use. One major constraint on the H-I rocket, the H-II's predecessor, was that Japan was prohibited from launching foreign satellites with it. The H-II rocket, for its part, can lift a 2.2-ton satellite into geostationary orbit--35,786 km altitude above Earth--so it can launch almost any kind of satellite. That means now that Japan is free from constraints, it can forge into the commercial launching business. But few officials seem all that enthusiastic about the idea. ``The space development business isn't paying well at the moment, and we don't see a rosy future,'' said Hiroshi Harada, general manager of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' space systems department. Added Jean-Louis Claudon, Asia-Pacific representative of Arianespace: ``Because the worldwide commercial-satellite market is not growing, and the number of rockets (needed to launch the satellites) is growing, the market is getting very competitive. It's not going to be easy for the competitors to make profits.'' The pride of the H-II is the first-stage main engine, dubbed the LE-7, whose development caused the two explosions that claimed one life and delayed the launch. The engine is fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen--the H for H-II stands for hydrogen--and functions in the same way as the motor of the U.S. space shuttle. Yet even though the H-II's technology is advanced, that is ``not really important from the point of view of commercialization,'' said Arianespace's Claudon. The technology ``doesn't mean much to customers,'' who attach greater importance to proven reliability and cost, he said. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] estimates that the annual domestic space industry market is &yen;308 billion. Yet in a departure from usual practice, MITI has declined to project the future size of the market, implicitly acknowledging that the question is too politically charged. The reason: Two-thirds of the &yen;308 billion cost comes from the national budget, and ``the question of how big a market it will become is equivalent to asking how much the government's allowance is going to increase,'' said Masao Omichi, director of MITI's Space Industry Division. Small budget The government's total space-related budget for fiscal 1993, ending next March, is &yen;201.7 billion ($1.83 billion), whereas NASA in the United States spent $14.33 billion in fiscal 1993. ``We won't be able to get along without depending on the national budget,'' although government projects are not profitable, said Harada of Mitsubishi Heavy. Half the money spent on making the H-II was collected by Mitsubishi, Japan's largest launching-vehicle producer, which records space-related sales of up to &yen;50 billion a year. ``The development of the H-II is designed to advance Japan's technology'' rather than generate new business, said Harada, echoing the comments by many of those involved in the space program here. The H-II is booked until its sixth launching in summer 1997. Apparatus such as the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite and Communications and Broadcasting Engineering Test Satellite will be hoisted. Although several more satellites are planned to come after that, none of them are for commercial purposes. ``The future of the H-II is utterly black,'' said Nobuo Nakatomi, an aerospace analyst who is a fellow scientist at NASA of the United States. ``Japan has to think seriously about which area the H-II can be most useful,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, it seems that no one here is doing that.'' Unmanned Shuttle Planned But commercial uses or not, Japan still has big plans for the H-II. The rocket is meant to hoist the nation's unmanned space shuttle--dubbed HOPE--by the year 2010, although its development is still in the primary stages. An orbital re-entry experiment (OREX) vehicle launched on the H-II rocket's maiden flight is designed to contribute to the construction of the HOPE. Two hours after the lift-off, the OREX vehicle successfully splashed into the Pacific Ocean, after it completed transmitting all the important basic data to the ground stations on how it endured the 1,600 C heat and other conditions in re-entering the atmosphere. Also, NASDA will be trying to work out plans to send man to the moon with the H-II to investigate and collect resources. Still, two significant barriers remain for the space program, said Hiroshi Imamura, executive vice president of Rocket System Corp., Japan's only rocket-purchasing and launching company that was established in 1990 by NASDA and 75 aerospace firms. One is that the H-II may be launched from Tanegashima--40km off the southern coast of Kyushu, Japan's southernmost main island--only twice a year. NASDA pledged to five fishermen's unions that operate in the surrounding waters that the rocket will be launched only during a 45-day period during the summer and a similar period in the winter, times when fishermen take breaks from work. The other barrier is the vast cost of the undertaking. It costs about &yen;19 billion for a single launching of the H-II, &yen;16 billion of which goes toward manufacturing the vehicle. Arianespace, the world's first commercial satellite-launching company that now holds about 60% of the market, charges only half the price that Japan's H-II would. Arianespace launches a satellite once a month on average, although its next launch will be delayed for a few months because of the January mishap. When the H-II was initially planned 10 years ago, the currency-exchange rate was &yen;220 to the dollar. Since then, the yen has surged up to the &yen;110 level, which makes it hard for Japan to compete in the commercial launching market. Not surprisingly, Imamura said his company is ``trying to find a way to reduce costs by 30%.''"

            "text": "Language: English Article Type:CSO [Text] Since the 1957 launching of the Vostok I satellite, the world's space utilization has been making rapid progress, mainly in the fields of observations of various kinds and communication satellites. Utilization of the space environment began with the Skylab project of the United States and became steadily established with the 1983 launch of the space shuttle/skylab. Thus, utilization of the space environment is a relatively new field. Utilization of the space environment means conducting various kinds of space experiments that cannot be carried out on the Earth, making use of the special environment of space. This offers conditions of microgravity, high vacuum, extremely low temperature, etc., conditions that can be obtained on orbits around the Earth. Japan's utilization of the space environment began with the first material processing test (FMPT) carried out in September 1992 and will become fully-fledged with the scheduled construction of a space station at the onset of the 21st century. The following passage gives a description of space environment utilization, how Japan is tackling the subject, and what prospects are seen in the field. Microgravity In a space ship orbiting the Earth, the centrifugal force applied on the ship offsets the gravitational force of the Earth and gravity does not work. Utilitization of the microgravity environment presents itself as the biggest progress made so far in the attempt to utilize the space environment. We are living on the surface of the Earth, subjected to the Earth's gravity and protected by its atmosphere. In such an environment, man has been investigating various phenomena and making use of the findings. Various parameters, such as temperature and pressure, seriously affect the chemical and physical activities of substances in scientific tests. The investigation of such phenomena was, however, made on the Earth because there was no need to consider a different environment. Today, however, the progress made in scientific technology points to the need for more essential research and the utilization of various phenomena. An environment without gravity is certain to enable man to look for new materials that cannot be produced on the Earth and to investigate life and other basic phenomena, bringing much new knowledge. We have so far been analyzing various phenomena and utilizing the findings in the world filtered by gravity. If this filter is eliminated, what had been invisible so far should become visible and what had been visible should appear differently. Various space experiments can be performed, utilizing such a condition. The following are the space experiments Japan has carried out. 1. First Material Processing Test (FMPT) A Japanese astronaut boarded the space shuttle in September 1992 for the first time and a full-fledged space test was carried out jointly by Japan and the United States. This is the FMPT. During the eight-day flight of space shuttle Endeavor, 22 themes of Japanese material tests, 12 themes of Japanese life science tests and nine themes of U.S. tests, or a total of 43 theme tests were conducted. Japan was able to complete all tests on 34 themes. The FMPT suffered a ten year setback due to a delay in the U.S. space shuttle project and the 1986 Challenger explosion. However, this enabled Japan to make full preparations. Problems that occurred during the FMPT were solved by the efforts of related people and good luck, providing Japan with a precious experience. The FMPT was a manned space experiment carried out by Japanese payload specialist Mamoru Mohri which gave Japan valuable data on manned space technology. The TV screening of Dr. Mohri working aboard the shuttle gave many Japanese young people a keen interest in scientific technology and provided a chance to prevent them from avoiding scientific study courses. In the FMPT, it was learned that semiconductors of a high purity and quality that could not be produced on the Earth were able to be produced in space. An explosion phenomenon that could not be explained with conventional theories was also observed. Other test results pointing to the prospect of the utilization of space environment have also been announced. 2. International Microgravity Laboratory (IML) Project The International Microgravity Laboratory Project is a mission to conduct a series of microgravity experiments aboard space shuttles and the space lab of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It is an international mission for institutes of Japan, the United States, Europe and Canada to carry out various kinds of space experiments. Japan joined in the IML-1 held in January 1992 and conducted two tests on crystal growth of organic superconducting metal and on the detection and analysis of high-energy space radiation using biological samples. In the experiment into the crystallizing of organic superconducting metal, well-formed crystals able to endure structure analysis were obtained in a short period of time and the prospect of tests on the growth of crystals in space was improved. The IML-2 is scheduled to be held around July 1995 with Japan mounting six kinds of test devices for tests on 12 themes, centering on life science. It was decided in October last year that astronaut Chiaki Mukai, who won a high reputation in Japan and the United States for assisting the FMPT on the ground, is to board the space shuttle used in the IML-2. She is now undergoing training for conducting tests on as many as 80 themes presented by various countries. 3. SFU The SFU is a space experiment and observation system that can be recollected and used again. Unlike conventional artificial satellites, the SFU is planned to be launched with the H-II rocket now under development, to various kinds of space tests and observations in the orbit for a certain period of time and to be recollected on board a U.S. space shuttle for later use. Space Environment Utilization and Manned Space Activities There has been much discussion on whether space activities should be manned or unmanned. The current conclusion seems to be that that which can be done without the need of human supervision should be done by machine and that which needs human supervision should be done manned. After the second world war, there was remarkable progress in robot technology and this led to heated discussion on whether human supervision was necessary or whether robots should be used as far as possible. The search for coordination between man and robots may last forever. The good points of both man and robots must be fully utilized in space development. For example, earth observation satellites and communications, which operate constantly and do not need to make timely changes in their functions, can remain unmanned. In the field of space environment utilization, many space tests require timely handling by man. A manned space test has the merit of on-the-spot observation and the timely handling of trouble, while an unmanned space test can be conducted in microgravity environment better and at a relatively lower cost. The robots to be used must master professional human skills, but they are yet in the learning process. Various kinds of data should perhaps be collected by manned activities for the time being, and technology for unmanned activities should be developed, using the accumulated data. The FMPT proved that human activities in space can raise people's consciousness toward scientific technology. The TV screening of astronaut Mohri's space activities revived people's interest in scientific technology. The source of the evolution of living things born on the Earth has been the curiosity toward and the search of the unknown. Japan is now training would-be astronauts to board a space station. Among the trainees, Koichi Wakata completed his training at NASA and was recognized as a mission specialist (MS), and a qualified astronaut by NASA. Wakata is expected to participate in high-level system operation training in readiness for the opportunity of space flight. Astronaut Takao Doi was employed by NASDA together with Mohri and Mukai as staff for the FMPT and offered ground support of the FMPT tests in orbit. Doi will participate in the mission specialist training course to begin in fiscal 1994 to get an MS license. In Japan, would-be astronauts are generally recruited publicly, and those who are accepted must abandon their past careers. They have to be prepared for this shift, while the employer, on his side, is obliged to duly reward them. The continuous employment of future astronauts must be elaborately planned with consideration due to the training of staff to board the space station. Toward the Space Station Era Japan, the United States, Europe and Canada plan to jointly construct a space station on an orbit at an altitude of about 400 kilometers from the end of this century through the early 21st century. The space station is a lasting, multi-purpose manned space facility. Each country is to supply its own station parts and offer some of its station space to the United States, in charge of constructing common parts, in exchange for electricity and other resources to be offered by the United States. Japan is promoting a project to develop, operate and utilize a Japanese experimental module (JEM), which will enable Japan to conduct manned space tests regularly over a long period of time. Japan has been openly inviting suggestions on experimental themes. In July this year, a primary selection of 50 themes for tests aboard JEM was made after an invitation of such test themes was issued in October last year. The test themes will be elaborated and the equipment to be mounted on JEM will be decided three years prior to the tests. At present, suggestions of test themes are to be accepted until six years prior to the tests. This is according to the condition that international adjustment for testing plans is to be completed within five years before the test time and that the final decision of test themes is to be reached within three years prior to the tests. Moreover, space tests require elaborate preparations. Japan has just begun to plan its space experiments and must improve its software and hardware for the efficient compilation of test plans. By accumulating space experiment technology, Japan must make efforts to shorten the period it requires between the proposal of themes and the actual holding of the tests. Space experiments are very costly and require long, elaborate preparations, including preliminary tests. It is not something that can be done quickly. Therefore, it is necessary to dig out the latent needs of the researchers who wish to conduct space tests but are unable to do so. While taking a practical approach, it is required to make systematic, well-planned promotion of ground researches, preliminary testing and space experiments. To meet this end, Japan is studying how to conduct space experiments on the basis of cooperative research structure that makes the utmost use of brains, technology and knowledge held by the industrial, academic and governmental circles pertaining to hopeful research themes. After the end of the Cold War, space development competition between the United States and the Soviet Union ended and various countries are presently studying plans to utilize the space environment in many fields. Japan, too, will be urged to positively tackle space environment utilization and to achieve good results."

            "text": "Language: English Article Type:CSO [Text] Foreword The first flight of the U.S. space shuttle in April, 1981, heralded the era of winged space transfer and return vehicles. This successful flight spurred the research and development of winged transfer and return vehicles in various other countries and led to the launching of Buran by the former Soviet Union and the research and development of Hermes in Europe. There are two conceivable types of space transfer and return vehicles--the winged type and the capsule type. The winged type is more effective when operation flexibility is required in missions, such as conducting experiments with large-sized equipment or quickly and accurately retrieving flying objects that elude high gravity loads. Japan started research on a winged transfer and return vehicle around 1986 and has compiled the concept of its own unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle launched by an expendable launch vehicle, commonly called HOPE: H-II Orbiting Plane. HOPE will be unmanned, have wings and be launched with an H-II launch vehicle or an H-II derivative launch vehicle. It will repair and refuel artificial satellites in space, conduct various kinds of experiments and observations utilizing the space environment, and transport materials to and retrieve materials from the Space Station. After carrying out various kinds of tasks, HOPE will reenter the atmosphere and land on the earth horizontally just as airplanes do. Report of the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and Return Systems in the Space Activities Commission The Space Activities Commission approved on 20 July 1993, a report compiled by the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and Return Systems (Chairman: Shigebumi Saito, Professor Emeritus at the University of Tokyo), calling for the research and development of such an unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle. The advisory panel was set up by the Commission in June last year to study and discuss Japan's future policy for the research and development of space transfer and return systems. The Panel comprises 25 experts not only in the field of aeronautics and space, but also in other disrelated fields, including economics and law. The Panel has held five meetings beginning in November last year. The following are the recommendations of the advisory panel in their report: (1) Significance of Space Development The development of outer space within the range of the earth is man's exploration of future resources. The scientific activities in space to uncover the truth herald a new era for civilization and will bring more richness. It is necessary for Japan, as an economic superpower and a science and technology power, to play an active part in the tackling of space development to fully utilize outer space within the range of the earth and thus contributing to international society. (2) Significance and Necessity of Space Transfer and Return System The space transfer and return system is the base of space infrastructure, which is a basic system that is capable of handling a wide variety of missions. An infrastructure is necessary for efficient and flexible space development activities. The transfer and return system is necessary for the service on orbits such as the verification, repair, re-supply, replacement and retrieval of satellites. The system is also needed to conduct experiments and observation, utilizing the space environment, and to transport cargo to a space station. The system is indispensable for Japan's stable implementation of space development activities in outer space within the range of the earth. The research and development of such a system will largely contribute to the maintenance and development of transport technology, which is the keystone of space activities, as well as to the promotion of science and technology. (3) Basic Concept of Research and Development of the Japanese Space Transfer and Return System It is important to promote the research and development of HOPE for practical purposes, this being an unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle launched by an expendable launch vehicle, in the early 21st century. The needs for the transfer and return of cargo in space are likely to increase in the early 2000s. Today, no other country is capable of providing an unmanned transfer and return system. Japan could build its own unique status in the world's space activities by the development of the unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle HOPE. Furthermore, the unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle technology could ensure Japan's steady development of space technology for the future as basic technology for a manned transfer and return vehicle, a fully re-usable transport system and a space plane. (4) Concrete Policy of Research and Development As a basic policy, Japan should divide the plans into two phases: the first stage is for the flight experiment R&amp;D plan; the second stage is for the development plan for practical use. At the first stage, it should be accomplished to acquire the key technology for HOPE within this century through the flight of the space re-entry flight experiment vehicle commonly called HOPE-X: HOPE-Experiment, which would enable Japan to establish the technology in the phases of launching, re-entering and landing. At the second stage, it should be accomplished to develop HOPE by means of adding the necessary mission capabilities after the first stage. The shift to the second stage should be strictly scrutinized by the Space Activities Commission, which should make policy judgment by fully checking technical achievement in the first stage. The key roles in the research and development of the unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle should be played jointly by the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) and the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). Outline of HOPE The winged transfer and return vehicle HOPE will be operated unmanned in whole processes, beginning with its launching, followed by entry into orbit, change of orbit, de-orbiting, returning and landing. NASDA plans to set the gross weight of HOPE, to be launched by an H-II derivative launch vehicle, at about 20 tons. NASDA says HOPE should be able to transfer three to five tons of cargo to and from the Space Station, etc. The dry weight of the HOPE vehicle, subtracting the weight of propellant and cargo from the gross weight, will be set at about ten tons and the vehicle structure weight, including heat protection materials, will be at about five tons. The length of HOPE will be about 15 meters, the width of its wings about ten meters and its fuselage will have a diameter of about three meters. Tip fins with a height of about three meters will be installed at both ends of the main wings. HOPE's total flight time, beginning with its launch followed by its stay in the orbit and ending with the landing, will be between four to seven days. At the time of return, HOPE will de-orbit, using an orbit changing engine, reenter the atmosphere at an altitude of about 120 kilometers and go through the aerodynamic heating control and balanced gliding phases. Adjusting its energy, the vehicle will finally reach the landing strip. Two practical HOPE planes would be operated, and each would be launched once a year and would have a life of ten years. Needed to develop HOPE are the aerodynamic technology to determine a vehicle shape that is able to cope with all speeds from hyper-sonic to low speed and the heat structure technology to endure aerodynamic heating at the time of reentry into the atmosphere. Also needed are guidance control technology for the automatic navigation of HOPE in all flight processes and the technology of long-life propulsion. Finally, a system technology to balance and combine the above is needed. Therefore, as the first stage Japan is studying plans to develop critical technology and to conduct an orbital reentry experiment (OREX), automatic landing flight experiment (ALFLEX) and hyper-sonic flight experiment (HYFLEX), using small models to verify developed technology. Following the three kinds of flight tests, a flight test using an actual sized experimental model (HOPE-X) is planned as the goal of the first stage. Postscript The establishment of the space transfer and return system is, thus, indispensable for Japan's future space activities and its contribution to the international society in the space development field. The Science and Technology Agency, on the basis of the report compiled by the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and Return System, is to promote research and development, aiming at putting into practical use the unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle HOPE, launched by an expendable launch vehicle in the early 21st century."

            "text": "Language: English Article Type:CSO [Article by Masato Yamano, President National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) at Asia-Pacific ISY Conference, 19 November 1992] [Text] Preface Given their relatively short history, science and technology have been responsible for social and economic progress, and for advances in the standard of living for mankind. However, while we have been enjoying this progress, these advances have imposed burdens on the Earth, particularly in the degradation of the environment and in the depletion of energy and resources. Two decades ago, the Club of Rome proposed, in ``the Limit to Growth,'' that there should be an overall zero growth to avoid the mankind's crisis anticipated in the middle of the 21st century and to prevent continued environmental degradation of the Earth due to industrial activities. Although its predictions about the Earth may be valid, we have been enjoying an affluent life. We have thus come to realize, given the aspiration of people toward a more affluent life and the orientation of developing nation toward modernization, that zero economic growth is not practical. At the present, the world population stands at about 5.5 billion. According to the United Nations' White Paper, this population will exceed 10 billion by the year 2050 and will continue even further. Should human activities continue to expand, accompanying such population increase and economic growth, the support system provided by the Earth, such an supply of food, resources and restoration of nature, may be destroyed. It is thus important to control the increase of population, to reduce consumption, and to recycle resources. However, I think that we are approaching to the point where we cannot overcome the foreseen crisis by such passive measures alone. Since the Earth is finite, we must look beyond the Earth to the infinity of space, the ``New Frontier,'' with every effective means for developing space in order to overcome such obstacles and problems and achieve a sustainable development for mankind. In the past, Columbus, in his endeavor to locate ``the Golden Country'' (Japan), discovered a new continent by coincidence. Five hundred years later, we, with a firm perception of expanding a frontier for human activities, are at the dawn of ``the Second Age of the Great Voyage.'' The imminent challenge of the present space development in the ``Mission to Planet Earth,'' which is also the major topic of International Space Year (ISY) 1992. I think that in the 21st century we will enter the era of ``Mission from Planet Earth.'' When we are going to expand our living sphere beyond the confines of the Earth and to pursue new discoveries, it is inevitable and natural for space to become our theater. Ever since the launch of Sputnik, space development worldwide has undergone major advances: varieties of satellite use for communication, broadcasting, and Earth observation; man on the Moon; planet explorations; manned space activities. With those tremendous advances, dreams of mankind have been realized one after another. Based on our accomplishment in space hitherto, the concept to expand the human frontiers into space might never be ``castle in the air.'' In order to explore a new frontier in space for mankind, the global scale cooperation is essential. Under reconciliation between East and West, we will need to organize a new comprehensive mechanism in the 21st century in order to achieve our common targets of mankind. We will also need to establish a more harmonious system of rule and law. What is most essential, however, is to achieve the understanding of people, to raise national will, and to establish an international consensus. Therefore, it is to say that the key is the resolution of mankind to what extent he is willing to make the crucial effort. Hereafter, I will focus on what are technical challenges and to what extent they are feasible in order to expand the new frontier for human activities. I will not touch upon the topics of a new, comprehensive mechanism, or ideas for a system of rule and law. Speaking about the future space activities in the 21st century, the content and substance differ depending on the time horizon. I will define the year 2030, when the current space activities will be terminated, as the time horizon that I am speaking about. Man in ``Near Space'' If we expected the frontier of human activities in the middle of the 21st century, the theater will be limited, at most, to our solar system. Furthermore, I don't think that Mercury or Venus will become the frontier for mankind by the middle of the 21st century because their temperatures exceed 400C. It would also be impossible to include the planets beyond Jupiter in this frontier because it takes more than a thousand days to reach from the Earth. Meanwhile, Mars is somewhat under the similar environment to that of the Earth--a gravity of 0.38G, surface temperature from -140C to 20C, a thin layer of atmosphere--and it only takes about 240 days to reach. Therefore, Mars can be considered as one frontier for mankind in the middle of the 21st century. In the Middle of the 21st century, it is conceivable that the artificial celestial bodies near the Earth--Space Station, spaceport--the Moon and Mars would be the frontier, the area in which mankind would be conducting their activities. I will call the frontier, encompassing these bodies, ``Near Space.'' Technological Challenge and Response What technological challenge must be met for mankind to advance into ``Near Space?'' What responses are needed to overcome such technological challenges? 1. Environment for life in space In ``Near Space,'' the gravity, radiation and thermal environments are remarkably different from those on the Earth. Men have stayed in space aboard Mir station for up to one year. We have learned that man can return to daily life with rehabilitation after staying in space for several days. However, such experience does not enable us to fully understand the impact that long stays in space will have upon the human body. We must, hereafter, demonstrate how long mankind can stay in space; assess long-term physical responses to low/micro gravity, establish the methods to maintain health in space. The method may include providing artificial gravity, physical training and rehabilitation after returning to the Earth. If these challenges could be resolved through various experiments and tests on space stations, humans can stay about one year under microgravity on an artificial celestial body, and several years under low gravity on the Moon (0.17G) and Mars (0.38G). Theoretically, it's possible to make 1G gravity by rotating an artificial celestial body. However, this is economically infeasible because its structure and weight become too enormous. As for the radiation environment, man can protect himself by the sufficient heavy blocking insulator of water, metals or other materials. Thus, the challenge is to develop methods of blocking radiation at minimum cost. The thermal environment on an artificial celestial body can be easily controlled by the current technology which has been applied to most artificial satellites. Control would also be feasible if residential areas were constructed underground on the Moon and Mars. 2. Oxygen, Water and Food Oxygen, water and food are indispensable commodities for man's survival. There are two ways to provide these in ``Near Space'': transport from the ground or produce them in space. It is simple to transport them from the Earth. However, transportation cost becomes too much to support many people living in space for long period, it will be imperative to obtain materials as much as possible in ``Near Space'' and to recycle what is used. Oxygen can be reproduced from exhaled carbon dioxide (CO[.sup]2[/]. On an artificial celestial body, oxygen could be obtained through the two processes: hydrogen reduction of CO[.sup]2[/] to H[.sub]2[/]0, and then electrolysis of H[.sup]2[/]0. This technology of oxygen plants has already been established on the ground. The future challenges are to improve efficiency through improving catalysts, to reduce size, and to develop easily maintained systems. In addition, oxygen could be produced from the oxidized metals which constitute 42% of the soil of the surface on the Moon and by using carbon dioxide (CO[.sup]2[/]) which constitutes 95% of the atmosphere on Mars. Research and development of producing oxygen with similar compound on the ground has been initiated. This technology will almost certainly be of practical use in the middle of the 21st century. Water can be reproduced by recycling waste hygiene water and urine. The technology to recycle water by means of film filter and distillation has been under development for Space Station ``Freedom.'' An advanced system could be utilized by the middle 21st century. Water can also be produced from lunar soil and from the atmosphere or permafrost of Mars. The production technology could be of practical use for supplying water in the middle of the 21st century. Food is basically supplied by a comprehensive organic recycling system which produces and decomposes organic matter. A part of this recycling system, with plants only, has already been verified on the ground. The challenge is to improve this system for use in space. Advanced comprehensive organic recycling systems including animals are exceedingly difficult to control, so this system will not be realized by the middle of the 21st century. Thus astronauts could not enjoy beef, but might eat vegetables and artificial meats produced in ``Near Space.'' 3. Transportation For the transportation to the Moon or Mars, two-phase-method will be probably employed rather than the direct transporting method like Apollo program. In this two-phase-method, two different types of space vehicles will be developed and used: one from ground to the spaceport in low Earth orbit, and from spaceport to the Moon or Mars. The advantage of this method is that varieties of space transportation systems can be flexibly assembled at the spaceport. And thus it is not necessary to develop and launch a huge space transportation system from the Earth to low Earth orbit. The existing largest launch vehicle has payload capability of 100 ton into low Earth orbit. Development of larger scale launch vehicle for the first phase, whose payload capability is 200 to 300 ton, may be considered economical in the long run because we can reduce the amount of launch. For the second phase of the transportation from Earth orbit to the Moon, Mars, mission-oriented systems will be assembled at the spaceport. If the existing chemical propulsion is to be used, the propellant, in particular oxygen, will occupy most of the mass. The net mass transported will amount to only one sixth of the total mass for the Moon, and only one tenth for Mars. It will, therefore, become necessary to produce propellant from resources on the Moon and Mars. Higher performance systems such as nuclear power must also be sought. The technological challenges for the future transport system are summarized in four thrusts: --Developing a large, economical rocket with 200 to 300 ton capability to low Earth orbit. --Establishing the technology to assemble large structures in Earth orbit. --Producing propellant on the Moon and Mars. --Pursuing Nuclear propellant system with safety consideration. By the middle of the 21st century, I suppose most of these tasks will have been definitely achieved. Robotics When man advances into ``Near Space,'' robots will play important roles. Since robots do not require the same safety and life support systems as much as man and they are economically advantageous, it is indeed natural to use robots as much as possible. Therefore, the extent of activities a man can do will depend upon how robots can be developed and used for human activities. Robotics will probably have made remarkable progress by the middle of the 21st century. Robots will be able to receive verbal commands in the language we use in daily life. On receiving such commands, robots will be able to think of the procedure, to choose the tools and to implement the tasks. When a man on the Earth orders a robot on Mars, ``The module has something wrong, please repair it,'' the robot will do it. The challenge in robotics is to develop advanced elements and components: electronics, precision machinery, information processing, control systems, and communication systems. Natural language comprehension, image recognition, understanding of the surrounding environment, selection of the solution and operations planning will also be the challenge for robotics. These elements and key technologies for robotics are now tremendously progressing and will be likely to make the greatest progress in the 21st century. After realization of these technical challenges hitherto mentioned, mankind will be able to stay for limited periods in ``Near Space'' by the middle of the 21st century. Regarding man's permanent stay in ``Near Space,'' we need further efforts to study the long-term effects of gravity and radiation on the human body before we can determine whether mankind will be able to live in ``Near Space'' permanently. Therefore, I see that the permanent stay in ``Near Space'' will still be the big challenge for mankind even in the middle of the 21st century. Space Activities in the 21st Century Based on the precious observations, I would like to show you my concepts for space activities around the middle of the 21st century. 1. On Artificial Celestial Bodies Artificial celestial bodies, such as a spaceport, a space factory, solar power satellites, space experiment/observation laboratories, will be orbiting around the Earth. For regular maintenance of these bodies, service robots will be operating around them. A spaceport will be a transfer station for the Moon and Mars. Propellants, supplies and foods will be brought to the spaceport from Earth to the Moon. There they will be loaded on a vehicle to be transported to the Moon, to Mars or to other artificial celestial bodies. The spacecraft is to dock at the spaceport and will be maintained and checked there. In the space factory, materials and pharmaceuticals with the highest utility value will have to be produced based upon selection of various microgravity experiments. These factories will have to be maintained by as few people as possible, and so will be highly automated. Energy required for manufacturing and living is to be transmitted either by microwave from the solar power satellites or from the solar power plants constructed at each space factory. Several experiments will be conducted in the space laboratory to investigate the long-term effects of low gravity upon animals and plants. Short-term living in ``Near Space'' will become easier, and eventually tourists will visit for space sight-seeing. 2. On the Moon On the Moon there will be habitation areas, lunarports, mining sites, factories, experiment laboratories, and observatories. The lunarport, in addition to launching and landing facilities of vehicles, will have a mass driver using a catapult for cargo transport. After the initial phase of resource exploration, industrial mining of resources will have started by this time. A few people will be regularly stationed at each mining site. If nuclear fusion power plant is operated on the Earth, then mining of helium 3 on the lunar surface is probably on a large scale. Some lunar factories, which will be installed after the verification of the pilot plant stage, will be operating. A limited number of workers and a lot of robots will be working there. Products made on the Moon will include oxygen and water, structural materials such as bricks, glass, cement, steels, aluminum, and other metals. Comprehensive organic recycling systems plants will produce bread, vegetables and artificial meats. It may be possible by this time to raise chickens and fish. There is no atmosphere on the Moon to cause flickering which degrades observations from the Earth. The Moon is thus very suitable for installation of optical and electrical observatory stations. Tourists from the Earth may eventually have vacation on the Moon. 3. On Mars An outpost base will be established on Mars in the middle of the 21st century. As it takes 240 days to reach Mars, and the flight opportunity is once every two years, the whole itinerary of one person would take 3 to 5 years. Therefore the personnel at this outpost must include doctors, civil engineers, architects, experts on the heat environmental control and the life support system, and so forth. Over ten people comprising various experts and specialists as well as appropriate facilities will be required to support the outpost on Mars. At the outpost on Mars, the first stage of the research will be completed, and pilot plants will be operating to conduct resource explorations, experimentally grow vegetables and breed animals, and produce oxygen and water. It is widely recognized that Mars may have been inhabited by living creatures. By studying the cause of their extinction from Mars, we may get important information about global environmental changes. The research in this area will advance on Mars. Conclusion The primary goal of the space activities in the 21st century might be the ``Mission from Planet Earth.'' The concept I presented to you is not only my perspectives of the future but also reflections on my aspiration and will. As the head of a space agency, I should drive forward to realizing the concept just mentioned to expand new frontiers into space. As I mentioned earlier, the space development of the 21st century is going to be grand project which far exceeds the scale of current space activities. It cannot be done solely by one country, but rather should be collaborated by joint efforts of many countries. Space development in the 21st century is not for the national interests of one country alone; it is an undertaking for all mankind, and trasncending national borders. I hope that this Asia-Pacific ISY Conference in commemoration of the International Space Year will give us the momentum to further strengthen cooperation among countries worldwide. I wish we would go side-by-side and jointly challenge toward the future of expanding a frontier for human activities in space."

            "text": "Language: Russian Article Type:CSO [Article by Lev Kamanin, under the rubric \"Opinion\": \"The Space Joint Enterprise `Alpha': Will It Happen or Not? Recent Rivals Are Interested in Collaboration in Orbit\"; first two paragraphs are source introduction] [Text] According to the predictions of futurologists, a cherished dream of mankind will be fulfilled in 2017 -- the flight of an international crew to Mars that will put researchers on the planet's surface. The choice of that year for the Mars mission was, of course, no accident: that's the year of the next occurrence of the closest approach of the blue and red planets, during which their orbits will closest to each other. But even with the most favorable conditions for the mission, the flight to Mars and back to Earth will take about two years. The only way to prepare the cosmonauts for such a journey and to be make certain that the life-support systems are reliable under conditions of long-term weightlessness is aboard a long-duration orbital station. Two Tactics After the successful completion in the summer of 1975 of the experiment in the Soyuz-Apollo program, the American astronauts didn't go into space for almost six years. Regular space missions were resumed in the United States in April 1981, aboard the Space Shuttle orbital airplane. Without their own long-duration orbital station, the Americans were forced to be content with short-term \"runs\" into near-Earth space. The U.S. tactic for exploring near-space was the opposite of ours, which consisted of long-term missions (up to a year or more) aboard the Salyut and Mir stations. True enough, about 10 years ago, an ambitious program for the creation of the international Freedom orbital station under the aegis of the United States appeared, but it was not judged to be implementable because of, first, the considerably higher cost of the Shuttle flights (by comparison with the cost of the project itself) and, second, the amplification of the confrontation between two superpowers in a cold war. The latter factor played a decisive role in the fate of the Freedom station. The fact is that at roughly that time, in response to the placement of Soviet missiles in countries of Eastern Europe, the U.S. government officially announced the adoption of the doctrine of SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, which aimed at developing protective laser armaments and placing them in space. Was the doctrine of \"star wars\" a flat-out bluff by the Pentagon? Military specialists still have to puzzle that out (reports have already appeared in the press about the falsification of results of supposedly successful tests involving the detection and interception of ballistic missiles by SDI systems). At any rate, even the powerful aerospace complex of the United States turned out to be incapable of simultaneously conducting work on the expensive SDI programs and Freedom -- and the preference was given to the former. The Death of the `Star Wars' Doctrine The intention of the United States to carry out the SDI program was taken at face value by the Soviet leadership. Mikhail Gorbachev declared more than once at strategic arms limitations talks that the response to the placement of SDI systems in space would be an \"unsymmetrical decision.\" And he kept his word. Hardly had the Americans managed to make sense of the results of the first tests in the SDI program, when, in something like two or three years, one of the contending superpowers collapsed. After that turn of events, the doctrine of \"star wars\" entered a phase of rapid withering. It couldn't be saved even by the extravagant announcement of our postcommunist leader about the readiness of Russia to take part in the further development of SDI, aimed now at either protecting against an attack by some third country or averting alien invasions predicted by astrologers or collisions between the Earth and asteroids. International Project Be that as it may, the Americans, after abandoning SDI, now had the opportunity to devote themselves to the Freedom station. As a result of the strict budget policy of Congress, which had cut back the annual appropriations for the Freedom program to $2.1 billion, NASA had to rework the design of the station substantially in order to reduce its size and cost. But at that time, rumors were afoot that Russia, which had become the successor to the Soviet Union, was getting ready to sell the existing Mir orbital complex. When those rumors couldn't be confirmed (who, after all, needs a station with only two or three years of service life left?), the U.S. administration strengthened its idea of building a long-duration orbital facility with the help of a number of Western European countries, as well as Japan and Canada. Soon after that, Russia, too, came to be regarded as a potential partner, and by as early as the summer of 1993, a fundamental agreement was reached between NASA and the Russian Space Agency (RKA) on the use of units of the Mir-2 orbital complex designed at NPO Energiya and a modified Soyuz spacecraft. As a result of subsequent talks, including talks at the governmental level, a version coordinated as of December 1993 was adopted for the international station Alpha, half of which consisted of Mir-2 modules. The other half of the long-duration Alpha station was to be represented by the laboratory and living compartment of the United States, the European and Japanese laboratories, and the Canadian module of service systems. Construction of the station in three stages is called for, with completion of the full-scale assembly in 2003, with a service life of 10-15 years. In Bed With the Russian Bear? It would seem that one could only welcome the agreement achieved as an important step on the path to expanding international cooperation in space research. In point of fact, however, the prospects for the practical realization of the Alpha project are far from rosy. First, still unresolved in the very important question of the status of the joint enterprise created in orbit -- things like the composition of and replacement schedules for the crews and the procedures for the use of experimental results by the partners. The European participants in the international project, unhappy about the fact that, for some reason, they were not invited to the negotiating table, have already expressed their own fears about being second-string partners because of the \"extraordinary activity of the Russians.\" The European Space Agency is concerned about the fate of the Columbus module (which costs $1.5 billion), which is being developed by Europe for the Freedom station and which may turn out to be superfluous in the event of a further transformation of the long-duration orbital facility project. Also showing dismay are the Japanese -- the developers of an experimental module whose cost is estimated at $662 million. Second, in the United States itself, the reaction to the Alpha project is not at all unified. If the president's team is unconditionally in support of the new design, a number of senators and a large group of representatives are assuming the role of ardent opponents to it. The debates in the Senate are particularly pointed. As reported in the weekly AVIATION WEEK AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY, one influential congressman even found it conceivable to go to Sen. Barbara Mikulski, who is responsible for NASA funding, with the clearly ungentlemanly question, \"Is the honorable madam chairman still really attracted to the idea of getting in bed with the Russian bear?\" Birthday Gift According to preliminary estimates by NASA specialists, the total spending by the United States for building the Alpha station will be $19.4 billion -- $4.7 billion less than the original Freedom project. Despite such substantial savings, a group of representatives sent Vice-President Gore a note in which they unanimously announced that \"Congress will insist that the United States is capable of building and putting on line its own station, without anybody's help and at any time.\" At the same time, however, supporters of the Alpha project feel that Russia, like the other partners in the international collaboration, should not require a cent of compensation for providing the Mir-2 modules, which will make it possible to build the long-duration orbital facility cheaper and two years faster. Russian specialists used to try to address the compensation issue, basing such compensation on the fact that, thanks to Russia's participation in the project, the United States will save $7 billion -- $4 billion as a result of the use of the Mir-2 modules, which are modified units of the tried and proven Mir complex, and $3 billion as a result of the reduction in the number of Shuttle flights needed. The White House administration and the NASA leadership, however, have wisely distanced themselves from the \"inappropriate\" claims of the Russian side. Acting on the principle \"not being too pushy,\" RKA director Yuriy Koptev, in an unofficial conversation with NASA director Daniel Goldin, announced that Russian is, as it were, in agreement with the \"free partnership\" for the realization of the joint project. That's why the appropriation of $400 million to the Russian side in the context of the contract concluded during the U.S. vice-president's December visit to Moscow can be regarded as nothing other than a birthday present. The hope is that that money, intended for supporting joint operations during the period of 1994-1997 -- that is, in the first, or preparatory, stage of the Alpha program -- will help to keep our space program afloat, that is, will preserve a considerable number of jobs at aerospace enterprises. Caution The U.S. congressmen who are against the Alpha project cite as their concern the political instability both in Russia itself and in a number of CIS countries. The disheartening results of the elections for the new Russian parliament are being used by them as just one more ponderous argument in support of their negative attitudes. And then there's the recent political maneuver by Kazakhstan, which required $7 billion a year in rent for the Baykonur launch facility, which was built with the money of the taxpayers of the entire Soviet Union, and five million hectares of desert allocated for military testing grounds. So one can understand the caution with which the U.S. and Western European community relate to Russia as a partner in all spheres of joint activity, including space activity."

            "text": "Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The National Space Development Agency of Japan [NASDA] will soon start remodeling the domestically-made, large-scale H-2 rocket, which was successfully test-launched recently. The remodeling will aim to cut costs and reinforce the H-2's launch capability to assist various related projects, such as construction of the Japanese space shuttle \"Hope\" and exploration of the moon and other planets. Armed with funds totalling approximately 11 billion yen in the draft budget for fiscal 1994, NASDA plans to first change the design of the engine and airframe. As the H-2 rocket is capable of launching a 2-ton-class satellite into geostationary orbit, projects have already been worked out to use it to launch meteorological satellites and other satellites capable of monitoring the global environment. NASDA has also started to develop a prototype of an unmanned space shuttle to be called Hope, which is scheduled to be launched by H-2. Without modification, however, the H-2 will be used in only a few, specialized areas and launch costs would be nearly double those of other countries. NASDA will, therefore, first try to cut manufacturing costs and modify the design to simplify the pipe arrangements and welding parts of the engine and airframe. It aims, reportedly, to cut launch costs by 30 percent. There are three different methods of reinforcing the rocket's launch capability: Increasing to six the two sets of solid fuel rocket boosters (SRB) which add driving force; installing two sets of a new type of booster which is composed of two units of the LE-7 main engine; and installing two sets of boosters composed of four units of the modified LE-7 engine, which uses hydrocarbon as its fuel. The capability of the H-2 rocket, which is capable only of launching 10-ton-class satellites into a low-altitude orbit at present, will be increased so that it can launch satellites of 15 tons, 17 tons, and 27 tons respectively. The government's Space Activities Committee is now studying a long-term space development program. Projects connected with future space activities in the 21st century are under discussion now. Suggestions include, for example, carrying out various space experiments on the HOPE, and also retrieving surface soil from the Mars using exploration spacecraft. Teruo Sofue, a staff member of the comprehensive development department at NASDA, said: \"By reinforcing the H-2 rocket, we can expand the range of space development. We would like to develop it into a rocket capable of engaging in a number of activities.\""

            "text": "Language: German Article Type:BFN [Report signed \"froe\": \"Euro-Spacemen Short of Funds\"] [Text] Bonn -- In redefining its space program, the European Space Agency, ESA, is counting on cooperation with the United States and Russia for cost reasons. At the ESA council meeting held in Paris on Monday [31 January], the funding of manned space travel could, however, not be resolved. This was reported by Research Minister Paul Krueger at a news conference in Bonn on Tuesday. According to the research minister, studies and preliminary research work on the European contribution to the international space station -- working title Columbus -- are to be carried out by the end of 1995. After that date, a decision shall be made on whether Colombus is to consist of any further elements beside a laboratory section that can be docked with the station. By June 1994, ESA wants to present proposals on how ESA can participate in the actual construction of the space station. The United States and Russia agreed on a large-scale cooperation last year. In addition, a new program for manned and unmanned transportation systems (MTSP) is to be worked out by the end of 1995. MTSP is to replace the ambitious Hermes project, which was mainly favored by France and was canceled for cost reasons last year. The new four-item program includes an \"intelligent top stage\" for the efficient Ariane-5 booster for approaching the space station automatically, and a transport capsule, which is also to be transported by Ariane. Krueger said Germany will try to become coordinator of the intelligent top stage, and France wants to take the leading role with the capsule. Funding has remained a controversial issue during the ESA meeting. The ESA financial system is based on calculation units that are fixed for one year. Due to changes in the ECU exchange rate, countries with devalued currencies have to make extra payments to ESA, while countries with upvalued currencies can expect refunds. Germany has suggested to introduce the ECU as calculation unit from 1 January 1997. It is expected that a compromise on the funding system will be reached on 15 February. According to ESA, some 540 million German marks [DM] have been allocated to Columbus during 1995/95, DM414 million to MTSP. Krueger emphasized that the envisaged costs for both programs will now only be some 40 percent of the costs estimated at the ESA meeting at the end of 1992. He said the German share in the programs will be DM120 million in 1994, and DM140 million in 1995. For the first time, Krueger lowered the ESA share in the 1994 research budget by DM62 million to DM1.092 trillion. ESA does not seem to be planning any cuts in its utilization programs, which includes the environment research satellite Envisat. Two new meteorological observation satellites are to be financed by the Federal Transportation Ministry. This means orders worth DM400 million for German industry. Josef Vosen, the Social Democratic Party of Germany research expert, said ESA is claiming insolvency. The financial problems of the devalued currency countries will mean higher contributions for Bonn, he said."

            "text": "Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] From FY94, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will begin developing technologies to convert diesel trucks, which belch black smoke and nitrogen oxides (NO[.sup]x[/]) as they run, into clean natural gas (CNG) trucks. This is a unique effort seen nowhere else in the world, and since natural gas is an abundant resource, achieving practical use of natural gas trucks will help conserve the environment and stimulate the use of alternative energies. NO[.sup]x[/] and black smoke emitted by diesel trucks are causes of air pollution in large cities. To suppress the emission of such pollutants, MOT is trying to convert medium-size diesel trucks to use clean, abundant natural gas for fuel. That is, diesel trucks running on the roads now will be transformed into natural gas trucks that will be kind to the environment. Compared to gasoline, natural gas emits less NO[.sup]x[/] and black smoke. The reason practical use of natural gas trucks has been slow is that natural gas is difficult to ignite; it is stable and difficult to burn. A characteristic of the diesel engine is that fuel is compressed, which causes self-ignition. Self-ignition of natural gas is difficult, however. Thus the idea of initially burning gasoline to assist ignition is being considered. Fuel compression ratio is expected to be about 16. Eventually, this will be replaced by an engine in which ignition of natural gas by itself will be possible. Additionally, because natural gas vehicles emit a substantial amount of methane, an unburned substance that causes global warming, a catalyst that will eliminate methane must be attached. MOT's research organization, the Traffic Safety and Pollution Research Institute, will develop an oxide catalyst or catalytic converter rhodium (CCRO) with strong methane clean-up capability and will establish operating standards. With the establishment of these technologies, diesel trucks will be reborn as natural gas trucks that will be kind to the environment and that will promote the use of alternative energies. MOT plans to use funds from the Environment Agency's budget to complete a series of research by FY97."

            "text": "The Japanese Government is supporting the development of fuel cell technology in its search for breakthroughs in clean technology. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has budgeted approximately 57 billion yen ($520 million) for its 17-year fuel cell development project. In 1993 the government organized a new national R&amp;D project, in coordination with the private sector, with the aim of becoming the world's leader in fuel cell technology. Fuel Cell Technology MITI has been promoting the development and use of fuel cell technology as a part of its R&amp;D project on advanced utilization of fossil fuels under its \"New Sunshine Program. \" Fuel cell power generation is a highly efficient, yet environmentally friendly technology that generates very little pollutants, such as C02, SOx and NOx emissions, and creates little noise and no hot waste water. Fuel cells generate power by converting fuel energy directly into electricity through chemical reaction. Natural gas, methanol, and coal-derived gas are used as fuels. The advantage of fuel cell power generation is that the technology is adaptable from small- scale dispersed systems to large-scale centralized power stations, with high energy efficiency as much as 40 to 60 percent. If exhaust heat is added, the total energy efficiency can reach 80 percent. According to the kind of electrolyte used, fuel cells are categorized into five types: Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC), Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC), Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell (PEFC), and Alkaline Fuel Cell (AFC). (SHIKEN KENKYUJO KENKYU KEIKAKU 1993) New Sunshine Program In order to promote comprehensive research and development in both the energy and environmental fields, in fiscal year (FY) 1993 MITI initiated a new plan called the \"New Sunshine Program,\" unifying three previously established projects--the Sunshine Project (new energy technology R&amp;D: established 1974), the Moonlight Project (energy efficiency technology development: established 1978), and the Global Environmental Technology Research and Development System (established 1989). MITI has budgeted approximately 57 billion yen ($520 million) for fuel cell projects for a 17-year period from FY81 to FY97 (MITI HANDBOOK 1990 AND 1992). The approximate budget allocation is as follows: Budget for Fuel Cell Projects FY90 FY91 FY92 FY93 (Unit: million yen) 3,180 3,738 4,332 5,039 (Unit: million dollars) 29 34 39 46 (Budget increase between FY90 and FY93 is approximately 58 percent.) The total budget for the New Sunshine Program for FY92 was approximately 38 billion yen ($350 million) and was increased to 41 billion yen ($373 million) for FY93. MITI allocated approximately 11 percent of the total budget for the fuel cell projects for FY92 and 12 percent for FY93 (SHIKEN KENKYUJO KENKYU KEIKAKU 1993). Fuel Cell Projects Under the New Sunshine Program This systematic national R&amp;D project for fuel cell technology was started in 1981, sponsored by MITI's Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). MITI's Agency of National Resources and Energy (ANRE) also started sponsoring a new field-test project, as well as a project for promoting fuel cell systems beginning in 1991. The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), a quasi-government organization under ANRE, was founded in 1980 to promote national R&amp;D projects on oil-alternative energy technologies and has been the primary agency overseeing the project since FY84 (JAPAN 21ST Nov 93, AIST 1993). Over 50 on-site PAFC power generation units are currently being operated for evaluation and demonstration at a number of utility testing facilities and customer buildings of major electric and gas companies in Japan. Some of these efforts are subsidized by MITI, with NEDO funding one third of the installation cost. Two projects were initiated in 1991 and 1992, targeting early market entry of PAFC. One of the projects is a private field test program subsidized by NEDO. The other project involves the development of two large-scale PAFC power plants--a 5-MW PAFC power plant for urban energy center application, which is under construction at Kansai Electric Power Company's Amagasaki Technoland (operation scheduled in FY94), and a 1-MW on-site PAFC co-generation plant, which is under construction at Tokyo Gas Company's Research Institute (operation scheduled in FY95). A PAFC technology research association, established in 1991 by 14 electric and gas utility companies, is promoting development and demonstration tests of these power plants (JAPAN 21ST Nov 1993, NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93). Toward a \"Comprehensive Policy Package\" The Advisory Committee for Energy was established in 1965 under the supervision of ANRE. Its function is to review and evaluate, at MITI's request, critical issues regarding long-term comprehensive measures to be taken to stabilize and rationalize energy supply. The committee can submit its \"views\" to the minister on critical issues. The Alternative Energy Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for Energy consists of officials from quasi-government organizations, officers of Japanese companies, journalists, and national university professors. A mid-term report entitled \"Promoting New Energy Toward the Year 2000\" was prepared by the Alternative Energy Subcommittee and appeared in MITI's information bulletin (TSUSANSHO KOHO 16 Dec 93). In the report, the subcommittee suggested the construction of a \"comprehensive policy package\" including establishment of infrastructure for new energy dissemination in view of regulations. Members of the Alternative Energy Subcommittee: Chairman Noboru Makino, director and senior adviser, Mitsubishi Research Institute Members from organizations under the supervision of MITI Hisao Oka, managing director, NEDO Takao Tominaga, vice chairman, Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) Koshiro Goda, managing director, the Japan Gas Association Seiichi Takayanagi, chairman, Energy System Policy Committee, the Japan Electrical Manufacturers' Association (JEMA) Riichi Hashimoto, chairman, New Energy Foundation (NEF) Tadashi Yorita, chairman, Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) Hideaki Ikuta, managing director, The Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEE) Other Members Teiichi Yamamoto, director, Japan Development Bank Haruki Asakawa, managing director, Central Electric Power Council Ikuyo Takase, vice chairman, Japan Coal Association Jiro Yamamoto, chairman, Technology Committee, Petroleum Association of Japan Kazuo Inamori, chairman, Kyocera Corporation Yoichi Kaya, professor, Dept. of Technology, The University of Tokyo Toshio Ojima, professor, Waseda University Takanobu Fujita, commentator, NHK Katsuhiko Suetsugu, editorial writer, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun Chikamori Kawagishi, editorial writer, the Yomiuri Shimbun Noriko Kimoto, commentator Government Incentives for Technological Development in the Private Sector In order to encourage R&amp;D by the private sector, tax incentives are offered for technological development and the Japan Development Bank (JDB) provides financing for the development of industrial technology. JDB was established in 1951 as a public financial institution whose mandate was to provide funds to private industry that would support government policies and initiatives. Effective until 31 March 1995, deductions can be taken from corporate (or income) tax of an amount equal to 20 percent of the excess of current qualified R&amp;D expenditure over the highest amount of the previous R&amp;D expenditure as well as seven percent of the acquisition price of facilities for conducting R&amp;D in fundamental technologies. Six percent of the qualified expenditure for collaborative research with national laboratories is tax deductible. Conditional loans are also available for development of applied energy technologies to assist private companies in the development of energy source alternatives to oil, methods of energy conservation, and electric power generation technologies. MITI budgets approximately 1.5 billion yen ($14 million) for development of applied oil-substitute technologies, 1.3 billion yen ($12 million) for development of applied technologies relating to rational energy use, and 472 million yen ($4.2 million) for development of applied new power generating technologies for FY93 (AIST 1993). Development Targets and R&amp;D Schedule of the New Sunshine Program The status of R&amp;D for each fuel cell type is described below. See also Attachment 1. Alkaline Fuel Cells R&amp;D for fundamental technology started in 1981. The 1-kW-class cell stack was developed, tested, and evaluated. R&amp;D was successfully concluded in 1984, with prospects for practical applications (SHIKEN KENKYUJO KENKYU KEIKAKU 1993). Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells The development of PAFC has progressed the farthest among all types of fuel cells. Between 1981 and 1984, fundamental technology R&amp;D for 1000-kW-class, low-temperature, low-pressure power plants and high-temperature, high-pressure power plants was conducted. A low-temperature, low-pressure power plant was built at Kansai Electric Power Company's Sakai Minato Station and a high- temperature, high-pressure power plant was built at Chubu Electric Power's Chita No. 2 Station in 1985 (SHIKEN KENKYUJO KENKYU KEIKAKU 1993). Development of PAFC has already achieved an overall energy efficiency of 80.2 percent and cumulative power generating time of 13,038 hours, in the case of the 200-kW-class combination module of thermal and electric power installed at the Osaka Plaza Hotel; and power generating efficiency of 39.7 percent with the cumulative operating time of 8,449 hours, in the case of the 200-kW-class power generating type installed on Tokashiki Island in Okinawa (SHIKEN KENKYUJO KENKYU KEIKAKU 1993, NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93). The LP Gas Promotion Center has jointly developed, with Fuji Electric Co., a 100-kW PAFC prototype plant using butane as fuel. Power generation efficiency is expected to be about 40 percent. Since butane is about 10 percent cheaper than propane and propane can also be used for the fuel cells designed for butane, the plant should be highly marketable, especially for industrial applications (See FBIS PERSPECTIVES Vol. 9, No. 1, 31 Jan 94). Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells MCFC technology is at the center of the fuel cell development project, since the cells serve as an alternative energy source to thermal power and use gasified coal as fuel. In FY94 NEDO is scheduled to inaugurate development of an MCFC-applied 1,000-kW power plant (KAGAKU K0GYO NIPP0 9 Sep 93). Fundamental technology R&amp;D started in 1981. NEDO has recently achieved the world record with its generation of 129 kW. It used 102 external-reformer-type, large-capacity cells, each with an electrode area of 1 square meter (See FBIS PERSPECTIVES Vol. 8, No. 11, 30 Nov 93). NEDO has also succeeded in continuous MCFC operation for 10,190 hours, with a voltage drop of 0.5 percent per 1,000 hours, using a 5-kW internal-reformer type cell. This achievement attained 33 kW with an electrode area of 0.5 square meters (NIKKAN K0GYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93). However, experts say fuel cells will have to operate continuously for a minimum of 40,000 hours before they can be used commercially (THE NIKKEI WEEKLY 2 Aug 93). MITI's AIST and the MCFC Power Generation System Technology Consortium have achieved their primary objective of putting MCFCs to practical use. The consortium was formed under the supervision of AIST as part of the New Sunshine Program for the development of new energy with participation of equipment manufacturers and utility companies (See Attachment 2). The performance test at the 100-kW plant at the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry's Akagi Experimental Center achieved 0.8 volts per 1 square centimeter of electrode at 150 milliampere of current for 1,000 hours of operation. Electric output after 1,000 hours of operation dropped only by a little over 1 percent. When the consortium builds the world's first 1,O00-kW experimental plant the electricity is expected to cost 14-15 yen (about 13 cents) per kilowatt, the power generation efficiency will reach 54 percent, and overall energy efficiency will reach 76 percent. These figures indicate that the plant should be commercially viable (See FBIS PERSPECTIVES Vol. 9, No. 1, 31 Jan 94). Solid Oxide Fuel Cells R&amp;D for fundamental SOFC technology started in 1981 and several 10-kW-class cell modules were successfully developed in 1991. Chubu Electric Power Co. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries have succeeded in generating power continuously for 7,000 hours, using two stacks of 7.5 cm x 7.5 cm advanced SOFCs, a world record. Each cell has a projected electrode area of 25 square centimeters, indicating 0.5 watts of output density, three times more than that of the conventional SOFC. Toho Gas Co. has set the world record for output density by achieving 1.61 watts per square centimeter for a single cell which was test-produced for a flat-plate SOFC (See FBIS PERSPECTIVES Vol. 9, No. 1, 31 Jan 94). Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells Fundamental PEFC technology R&amp;D started in 1992. A 200-watt cell is being developed by layering cells with an electrode area of 100 square centimeters (NIKAAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93). NEDO aims to develop 1-kW module and AIST targets to develop prototype 1-kW cell based on research at its Osaka Govern- ment Industrial Research Institute (See FBIS FOREIGN PRESS NOTE FB PN 93-169 19 Apr 93). R&amp;D Programs of National Laboratories The following is the list of national laboratories currently conducting R&amp;D activities for fuel cell technology under the New Sunshine Program and the budgets for specific projects for FY92 and FY93 (SHIKEN KENKYUJO KENKYU KEIKAKU 1993): FY92 FY93 National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research (NIMC), AIST (Unit:thousand yen) SOFC (R&amp;D/wet type technology) 2,938 (R&amp;D/evaluation) 23,941 PEFC (R&amp;D/fundamental technology) 1,000 (Evaluation of characteristics 5,010 of polymer film) Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL), AIST SOFC (R&amp;D/dry type technology) 5,130 4,784 (R&amp;D/efficiency of power generation) 46,600 46,000 National Institute for Resources and Environment, AIST SOFC (Research on a system to collect exhaust heat) 1,800 1,393 (Research on methods to evaluate systems to collect exhaust heat) 6,400 6,278 National Chemical Lab for Industry (NCLI), AIST SOFC (R&amp;D/wet type technology) 2,715 (R&amp;D/evaluat ion) 24,400 Government Industrial Research Institute, Osaka (GIRI, Osaka), AIST MCFC (Research on new component materials/composition materials) 4,130 4,036 (Test and evaluation of materials) 111,258 15,000 PEFC (Research on cell materials) 1,161 (Test and evaluation of fuel cells) 11,330 16,170 (Research) 1,250 Diffusion of Fuel Cell Technology The Advisory Committee for Energy submitted on 10 December 1993 its views about diffusion of fuel cell technology to MITI. In its report the committee recommended vigorous efforts for diffusion and R&amp;D of fuel cell technology. The committee identified problems which presently prevent fuel-cell technology from diffusion as follows: Although practical use of PAFC technology is on the way, long-term reliability of a cell and a fuel-cell plant has to be improved. In order to popularize construction of fuel-cell plants, construction cost need to be drastically reduced. Development should be focused on reliability and durability in long-term plant operation, utilizing all the data from field tests, as well as cost reduction, convenience for users, system standardization, and market expansion through diversification of fuel types. R&amp;D objectives for PAFC, including large-unit operation, high efficiency, cost reduction, and commercialization, should be also applied to MCFC, SOFC, and PEFC at each technology level (TSUSANSHO KOHO 16 Dec 93). The following chart compares the cost of new energy and existing power generation: Installation Cost Power Generation Cost (Unit: thousand yen) (Unit: yen) New Energy Photovoltaic Power 1,000/kW 71/kW h Wind Power 500/kW 32/kW h Fuel Cell 1,500/kW 35-46/kW h (peripheral equipment and protective devices not included) Existing Energy Petroleum Power 190/kW 11/kW h Coal Power 230/kW 10/kW h LNG Power 200/kW 10/kW h Nuclear Power 310/kW 9/kW h Hydraulic Power 640/kW 13/kW h (ENERUGI SEISAKU NO AYUMI TO TENBO, ANRE 1993) MITI's Efforts To Acquire Information from Overseas MITI participates in a cooperative research and information exchange program under the Committee on Energy Research and Technology (CERT) of the International Energy Agency (IEA). MITI joined the advanced fuel cell program in April 1990. AIST conducts comprehensive, in-depth surveys of trends in technology policies and R&amp;D projects in major countries, opinions on Japan's R&amp;D activities, and obstacles to international cooperation in R&amp;D. AIST procures a wide variety of publications, reports, and literature on foreign technology, mainly from the United States and Europe (AIST 1993). Another Fuel Cell Development Program The Ministry of Transport will begin development of vessels powered by fuel cells starting in FY94. The ministry plans to establish an organization jointly with major vessel manufacturers, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., in order to conduct a four-year plan to design, develop, and test a prototype vessel. The R&amp;D budget projected for this plan is 400 million yen ($3.6 million) per year and will be shared equally by the government and the private sector. The ministry aims to develop a 20-meter-class prototype vessel in four years (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 5 Jan 94).

            "text": "Language: French Article Type:CSO [Article by Cecile Remy and Tierry Mahe: \"Electric Cars: Who's Taking the Risk?\"; first paragraph is INDUSTRIES ET TECHNIQUES introduction] [Text] For a vehicle reputed to be quiet, the electric car has generated a lot of hype. Until Renault and PSA industrialize their concept-cars, small independent automakers will struggle on alone to build a future for electric vehicles--and assume all the risks. Two years ago PSA was trumpeting that France would have between 10,000 and 50,000 electric vehicles by 1995. Projections have since fallen to 5,000. The culprit, of course, is the recession. But cold feet on the part of big manufacturers and the cautious attitude of collectivities--the only players capable of \"getting the market off the ground\"--are also responsible. With no Draconian law in effect to curtail urban pollution1, cities saw electric cars mainly as an inexpensive way to fashion a \"glamorous\" image for themselves. Virtuous in the extreme, non-polluting, quiet, robust, and easy-to-drive and park electric cars are nonetheless guilty of one sin: they are expensive. The (1995) electrified version of the Clio, for instance, will cost 170,000 French francs [Fr], or three times as much as the standard one! The limited autonomy of electric vehicles and, most important, the lack of urban infrastructure (recharge terminals) also work against them. In fact, electric cars are the victims of a classic vicious circle: Limited infrastructure plus high prices equals few users and small production runs, thus keeping prices high and the number of customers low. This raises the question of who will take the risk of jumping in first. Initially, big automakers seemed the answer. So far, neither PSA nor Renault has done anything more than electrify very-small-run commercial vehicles. Renault will not start series production of the Master until March, or of the Express until October, 1994, following eight years of experimentation and 400,000 km of road tests at its Chatellerault pilot site. Moreover, annual production volumes will not exceed 1,000--a drop in the bucket! True, Renault's Clio and PSA's 106 and AX will come out in electrified versions by 1995. But here again, the doses will be homeopathic. Automakers are offering electrified \"commercial\" vehicles first, both to supply companies and collectivities and for technical reasons. Battery weight in relation to total weight is less of a drawback on commercial vehicles than it is on personal automobiles. In addition, the industrial investment needed to electrify vehicles is virtually negligeable. Laurent Bernard, project head of Renault's Electric Commercial Vehicles Division, confirms this. \"Whether or not the vehicle is electric makes no difference in the process. Clio's engine plant is replaced by its electrical equivalent. The only change is the addition of an assembly island to install the battery block.\" Launching series production of the first personal cars truly designed to be powered electrically would be striking evidence of the commitment of big automakers. Unfortunately, Renault's Zoom, Citroen's Citela, and Fiat's Downtown are still nothing more than elegant theoretical constructs, with no launch dates in sight. The same manufacturers have not yet definitively chosen between all-electric vehicles and hybrid ones, as evidenced by Volkswagen's Chico, BMW's E1, or Renault-Volvo's ECC. Most important, the pricing policy of big automakers is a huge discentive. \"It's because we haven't got costs under control. Seventy percent of the value of a traditional car is subcontracted, against 90 percent for an electric car!\" pleads Laurent Bernard of Renault. What might look like a wait-and-see attitude actually reflects real difficulties in keeping in step with a market whose volume is too low. As Dominique Mathon, director of Microcar (Jeanneau), explains, \"Starting at 5,000 cars a year, we would have to revamp our manufacturing process. In contrast, 5,000 is the break point at which big manufacturers can consider launching a series!\" So it is the \"Tom Thumbs\" of the industry that hold the future of the electric car in their hands, and will continue to do so for another several years. Most of these pioneers began as makers of small motorized vehicles that do not require driver's licenses and of commercial vehicles. Examples include Erad, Aixam, Microcar, and Automobiles Ligier. In producing electric cars, they are remaining faithful to their light, two-seater, urban vehicle niche. The automakers have banded together under the banner of Apvere. As Pierre Bazier of Rocaboy indicates, it is an objective alliance in which \"Each supplier offers a line that complements the others'.\" Adds Bazier, \"Each time one of us sells an electric car, he helps shore up the market.\" Jack Vergne, director of Seer-Volta, sees no reason to be anything but optimistic. \"Our production doubles every year: 75 vehicles in 1991-92, 150 in 1992-93. Our goal for 1994 is 300.\" The company has resolutely opted to produce just one product: a small commercial vehicle comparable to Citroen's C15 and Renault's Express for roughly the same price. How will the company be able to justify making its electric vehicle when the two groups launch their own series? Jack Vergne is untroubled. \"Unlike those `electrified' models, Volta was designed to be powered by an electrical engine. This shows in its performance. Volta has a payload of 500 kg, against 300 kg for the C15; its degree of lock is shorter; the car's batteries do not cut into the amount of space available in the interior; and its suspension has been adapted to handle the extra weight.\" Competition from the big names does not scare Pierre Bazier of Rocaboy either. \"Our model can be transformed in any way we need to.\" Erad agrees, pointing out that \"We are satisfying demands that the big car companies will never be able to meet. One example is a modified version with a very short degree of lock to enable it to maneuver easily in the tunnel under the Channel!\" Technologically, the companies must take a pragmatic approach, and the small firm Seer-Volta makes do with what it can find on the market. That means lead batteries and d.c. motors. \"Nickel-cadmium technology would push up the price of batteries from Fr17,000 to Fr70,000. If that happened, we would offer lease contracts to enable customers to stagger their payments.\" Most of the small car makers hold down their manufacturing costs by using non-industrialized technologies. Seer-Volta, for instance, buys its tubular frames from the supplier of Renault's Alpine. And it molds its body in polyester resin, a simple and cheap process that makes the vehicle quite light. Won't these modest processes curb production if the market takes off? \"Not at all. We can supply up to 1,000 vehicles a year without changing anything in our procedure,\" says Jack Vergne. Another shrewd move on the part of the automaker is avoiding the long and costly crash-test process. \"Volta features an `advanced cabin'; a simple Utac inspection is enough.\" Of all the automakers, Erad boasts the most varied line: three leisure vehicles (Agora, Spacia, Junior) and two commercial ones. Two years ago, electric vehicles accounted for two percent of its sales; today they make up 30 percent! Pascal Ansart, marketing director of Erad, describes the typical Homo Electricus Rex: \"He's a veterinarian! He uses the car for his work, in urban areas and over short distances. Since he travels alone, he appreciates a `two-seater' that is easy to park and less expensive than a thermal vehicle: Fr1,400 altogether against Fr1,700 a month for a diesel.\" At Fr51,000, Erad's Agora is certainly the cheapest vehicle on the market. \"It's because we make everything in house, using hyper-light materials. Agora weighs only 650 kg, including batteries. The vehicle's cost is tied directly to its weight/power ratio.\" Although the Junior is \"electrified\", the models that followed it were literally designed around batteries. \"The load is perfectly distributed, which gives the vehicle excellent steering. That is not true of electrified vehicles.\" Rocaboy, for its part, is a pioneer, having homologated its first electric vehicle in 1977! The RK200 commercial vehicle is now its leading product. Pierre Bazier, Rocaboy's director, explains. \"Electric vehicles are expensive, I agree; but in certain cases, a thermal model would be even more so! For instance, if thermals were required to run quietly or without spewing any emissions into the air. So we supply Atomic Energy Commission plants and the Louvre Museum with vehicles for their service areas. Electric vehicles are perfectly suited for industrial use involving stops and starts every 500 meters and close handling.\" Finally, there are the companies that design special-use vehicles: Sita and Semat for street cleaners and garbage trucks, and Charlatte for industrial vehicles. Says Sita's Alfred Trombini, \"Our electric models derive from thermal ones; they are quiet and non-polluting, two requirements which are found in certain municipal bid invitations. Given the price of this type of vehicle, the additional cost of electrification is only 10 to 30 percent.\" Such a small ratio makes it possible to retain a thermal engine to enable the vehicle to get back to repair shops and incineration plants, which are located far from urban areas. Small electric carmakers still have a few years before the \"big guys\" invade their turf. At that time they might taste the bitter experience of having been the first ones on the block. Then again, they could, in the meantime, widen the gap so far that they will become forces to be reckoned with. Boxed Material: Electric Vs. Electrified Vehicles \"Electrified\" vehicles are avatars of thermal ones--that is, they are series models whose original powerplants have been replaced by electric motors. All large-run personal vehicles will continue to be electrified versions for the next several years. Electric vehicles, in contrast, are designed with electrical propulsion in mind. Generally they feature two or three seats. Since battery weight and space needs are factored in from the outset, electric vehicles offer better skid resistance, comfort, and ergonomics. Their batteries, whose placement is better planned, do not cut into the room available in the vehicle's interior. In a Nutshell --Once they reach a volume of 5,000 a year, small manufacturers will have to revamp their production processes. That is still a ways down the road. --A vehicle designed to be powered electrically can carry 40 percent more payload than a classic electrified vehicle. --Agora weighs only 650 kg, including batteries. Photo Captions Sita has been making its Lama 6000 street cleaner since 1990. The same company supplies electric garbage trucks to the cities of Bordeaux and Paris. It was awarded the EUREKA label for one of its research programs on electric vehicles. Renault's Master and Express are electrified vehicles. Tested since 1986 in Chatellerault, they will be mass-produced in 1994. The city of Goteborg (Sweden) has ordered 200. Erad's Agora, made since early 1993, is the least expensive electric car on the market at Fr51,000. It is a small, two-seater, convertible with almost 2 HP! Its maker Erad is in the process of industrializing its shops to meet demand. The company expects to sell 450 electric cars (half personal, half commercial) in 1994. The BMW E1 is an example of a hybrid vehicle equipped with a combustion and an electric engine. It has the qualities of a road car and is expected to reach maximum speeds of 125 km/h on its electric engine. Peugeot's electric 106 and its AX cousin--also electric--will be given to 50 individual drivers for a year and a half in La Rochelle. This user test will precede product launch. It will also give the city a chance to test the smart-card-operated recharge terminals, slow recharge in parking lots, and quick recharge in certain gas stations. Renault's Zoom concept-car, devised by Matra Automobile, prefigures the urban electric car of the next millenium. Its rear suspension is mounted on a retractable chassis, which shortens it 60 cm and allows it to be parked perpendicular to the sidewalk. The Zoom's nickel-cadmium batteries are expected to give it automony of 150 km. In 1995, Renault should industrialize its first electric recreational vehicle, the Clio. Opel's Twin is a four-seater vehicle, with one seat in the front and three in the back. A 10-kW three-phase engine equips each wheel hub. The Twin can reach speeds of 120 km/h. Carbon-lithium batteries give it autonomy of 250 km. Footnotes 1. In California, the law requires that two percent of all vehicles be emission-free (and thus electric) by 1998, and that 10 percent meet that standard by 2003. In France, a 25 October 1991 decree defines special protection areas where prefects can take any measure needed to bring atmospheric pollution levels below an admissible threshold."

This new consumer product might also benefit electrical installers and mechanics. \"Electric cars require a 40-percent ratio of new components,\" says Jacques Saint Marc, general secretary of GIVE, the Interministerial Group for the Development of Electric Vehicles. Industrialization of the new product raises dazzling prospects of new technological outlets for electrochemistry, of course, and for electrical and electronics engineering. It allows planners to dream of new professions, from electrical installers of computerized point-of-sale devices, to mechanics certified as \"electric car maintenance technicians.\" The electric cars now on the market have given a few equipment manufacturers, such as Leroy Somer or Oldham, an opportunity to join the ranks of automobile equipment makers. Both already specialized in industrial traction--one for engines and the other for batteries. Like Valeo, auto equipment manufacturers are inclined to wait for the next generation of vehicles and firm orders before committing themselves to the market. The first component stimulated by electric cars is batteries. Field experiments conducted by cities and by Electricity of France (EDF) are expected to quickly produce a \"smart\" battery similar to sensors of a decade ago. \"The trick is to incorporate monitoring functions into the battery, so that it has a good energy gauge. The battery must control its life,\" explains Syriacus Bleijs, Electric Car Program coordinator at EDF's Research Division. The battery will feature sensors and electronics that will provide it with information on its available energy capacity, the amount of energy it could absorb via recharge, and its aging status. Renault's Express and Clio already have a small computer that fully controls the battery and that hooks up to the corrective maintenance unit available to dealers. Charger research is moving in the same direction, to determine whether batteries can tolerate rapid recharges. The goal is to restore 50 percent of a battery's capacity in 20 minutes. The 3.3-kWh terminals developed by Merlin Gerin and installed in La Rochelle recharge an electric car in eight hours. Rapid recharge terminals, which have been ordered from Westinghouse SGTE, should offer an additional 1-2 km of autonomy per minute. The rapid terminals offer far greater electrical power--over 30 kW--and research on them is being conducted as part of the European Elegie program. Induction recharge--that is, recharge without making contact--seems the best way to get electrical energy from the terminal to the car. The Praxitele program involving freely-traveling vehicles will experiment with this technique. Naturally, batteries themselves are spurring the creativity of many researchers. Most vehicles now on the road are equipped with lead batteries, which are the cheapest and best known. A few models are running on nickel-cadmium batteries, which are more expensive but offer more autonomy as well as an energy density of 65 Wh/kg against 35 Wh/kg for lead. By using other materials, electrochemists hope to push the limit beyond 100 Wh/kg and provide automobiles with autonomy of over 100 km. The 33 percent state-subsidized PREDIT, or Ground Transport Industries Research and Development Plan, has opted to push lithium batteries. It has teamed up with Saft to promote carbon-lithium ones, and with EDF, Bollore Technologies, and Grenoble University to push polymer-lithium batteries. According to Syriacus Bleijs, EDF's research coordinator, carbon-lithium batteries seem closer to industrialization than fully solid lithium ones do. Battery research has given rise to a new component: supercapacity, or a condensor that can deliver 10 kW/kg instantaneously. Supercapacity can handle strong acceleration surges, eliminating the traction power limitations of electric cars. When the supercapacity is discharged, it can also recover the energy produced during braking. PREDIT official Claude Prost-Dame says the very robust condensor seems well suited to automobile use. Engines do not require as much research as batteries. Electrical engineers need only adapt their old standbys, which, roughly speaking, consist of d.c. motors, induction motors, and autopiloted, synchronous motors. Adaptation means not only meeting the technical specifications of automakers, but learning to live with their test procedures and quality checks. Leroy Somer is undergoing that apprenticeship as it develops three lines of d.c. motors. Indeed, d.c. motors are the most common engines used in electric cars today. Leroy Somer has totally revamped its industrial traction models, while the Danish firm Thridge Enco custom-designed one to meet the demands of the automaker Erad. The advantage of this type of engine is that it is controlled by relatively simple and low-cost thyristor power electronics. Vector-control induction motors seem rather promising for upcoming models. They eliminate problems stemming from exhaust manifold wear, but require more complicated electronics, especially for starting. ABB has supplied Renault with a very compact prototype induction motor that can run at over 10,000 rev/min. A sensor placed directly over the rotor checks the state of the motor as it starts up. Michel Kant is working with Valeo at the University of Compiegne to study the various characteristics of autopiloted, synchronous motors and of vector-control induction engines in a Volta body. \"It is the whole pull chain that has to be considered, especially since it will not necessarily involve one motor, but two, or even four, one on each wheel,\" he says. The Engineering School of La Rochelle (EIGSI) is working on protocols for measurements made on electric vehicles. \"We have cabinets full of data that will not do us much good until we learn how to interpret them,\" stresses Claude Ades, one of the school's officials. \"We have modified the measuring center that is used by CERAVE, the Center for Applied Research on Electric Vehicles. And we are developing new test procedures to model the behavior of electric vehicle drivers.\" The long-term goal of the school's research is to devise an assisted-driving or automatic help system. If electrical cars never hit the road, they will at least have helped advance a number of techniques. And if their use becomes widespread, new occupations could spring up. The electrical installers responsible for recharge systems could become electrical experts in point-of-sale devices, and mechanics could become \"electric vehicle maintenance technicians.\" CERAVE has just teamed up with the La Rochelle Occupational Chamber to provide continuing adult education in \"electric vehicle maintenance\" to mechanics or newcomers (two years of college are desired) in 1994. The EDF-GDF Services Center in Versailles has also concluded a technical partnership agreement with Seer to provide maintenance for electric vehicles in the Paris area. In the meantime, more and more hip technocrats are rallying round the product--which uses technology to fight pollution for the benefit of local collectiviies--with the expectation that it will one day become a consumer product (what better issue to use in an electoral campaign!). We have already cited CERAVE, the Center for Applied Research on Electric Vehicles; PREDIT, the Ground Transport Industries Research and Development Plan; and GIVE, the Interministerial \"Electrical Vehicles\" Group. Other important names are ADEME, the Agency for the Development of the Environment and Energy Control; a manufacturer organization AVERE, the European Association for Electric Road Vehicles; and CETUR--soon to be renamed CERTU--which is a division of the Equipment, Transport, and Tourism Ministry that coordinates municipal programs. In a Nutshell --Batteries must become \"smart.\" They need the equivalent of a gauge so that drivers can know how much energy they have. --The goal of quick recharging is to provide 2 km of autonomy for each minute of recharge. --Vector-controlled induction motors seem fairly promising for the next crop of models."

The ESR uses a high-efficiency compact electric generating plant -- composed of batteries, an electric motor, an engine, and an electricity generator. This system gives the ESR an energy consumption rate superior to either combustion engines or conventional electric vehicles. ESR employs the Series Hybrid Electric system, with which the vehicle is always driven by an electric motor. The Series Hybrid Electric system is known as the most efficient among hybrid systems with two driving modes. The first is battery-operated mode, in which batteries supply energy to an electric motor. This driving mode has zero emissions.

            "text": "Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by Katsuki Yamashita] [Text] 1997 Is Deadline for Electric Car Development; Goal is Ni-MH Battery But Lead Is Realistic Automakers have begun concentrated efforts to develop electric vehicles in time for their fall 1997 product announcement. This is in response to new emissions regulations in the state of California in the United States that will begin in 1998. There is less than four years until that deadline. Manufacturers of batteries, semiconductors and motors will be involved. A serious problem for the automakers is the secondary battery. They want an advanced type of battery with high energy density. The top candidate is a nickel-hydrogen battery, but there are a mountain of problems to overcome to develop a practical model. It is likely that they will start with a lead battery, which has low energy density but has a record of safety and reliability. There is also hope for an Li-based battery in the 21st Century. The deadline for developing electric vehicles is the fall of 1997. Not much time is left. In the state of California in the United States, the new emissions regulation bill (the new clean air law) will go into effect in 1998. This regulation obligates each manufacturer to ensure that 2% of the total number of vehicles it sells are ``zero emission cars,'' and realistically speaking, these are electric vehicles (see Figure 1). Automakers probably will unveil electric vehicles responding to this regulation in the fall of 1997. This regulation will apply to automakers that sold 35,000 vehicles per year in California. That means that each manufacturer must sell a minimum of 700 electric vehicles. Automakers that do not meet this regulation will penalized heavily. Under the bill that was in force in 1992, the penalty was only a fine of $5,000 for each vehicle under the 2% minimum. The penalty was changed as a result of a review of the 1992 law, however, and now, automakers that cannot meet the regulation will not be able to sell any gasoline vehicles in California for the next year. Furthermore, this action will not stop with California alone. It is expected to expand to the eastern states in the future. For this reason, automakers are forced to make concentrated efforts to develop electric vehicles. They also are obligated to sell hybrid cars that jointly use internal combustion engines and motors (see Figure 1). Normally, automakers take four to five years to develop a new gasoline vehicle. They cannot meet the deadline if the basic design is not already firmed up. At the 30th Tokyo Motor Show, automakers displayed not only electric vehicles that were converted from gasoline vehicles, but also electric and hybrid vehicles that were newly designed from the chassis on up (see Figure 2 [omitted]). However, everyone involved with electric vehicles says, ``The electric vehicles that will be presented in the fall of 1997 will be different from this exhibition.'' According to Honda Motor Company, ``Development of electric vehicles to be sold in California in 1998 is being done in earnest apart from those exhibited here.'' Beneath the surface, tension is growing in the development of electric vehicles that actually will be sold. Figure 1. Electric Vehicle Introduction Schedule Under California's Clean Air Law Storage Battery Breakthrough Essential Electronics manufacturers play a big role in the development of electric vehicles. This is because the secondary battery (storage battery) and semiconductors for motor and power use are important technologies that make up the electric vehicle. Automakers have brought in manufacturers of batteries, semiconductors and motors to begin developing electric vehicles. Of these technologies, the storage battery is a serious bottleneck to popularization of the electric vehicle. According to a major battery manufacturer, ``A number of electric vehicle storage battery development projects are in progress in partnership with automakers.'' This is because storage battery performance decides a vehicle's basic performance, including acceleration and the distance the vehicle can travel on one charge. If a high energy density storage battery is developed, it will increase the distance traveled per charge. If output density (maximum power per unit weight that can be extracted instantaneously from the battery) can be raised, acceleration performance will improve. The automakers' minimum requirements are 70Wh/kg weight energy density, 130 W/kg output density and a cycle life of over 1,000 cycles (see Table 1). In addition, the safety condition of ensuring that shock to the battery will not cause an outbreak of fire is indispensable. Problems with reliability, such as battery capacity decreasing as a result of over-charging, also must be resolved. Eliminating the need for maintenance work, such as electrolytic solution replenishment, also is an important point. MITI Standardizes Five Items High cost is another factor that hinders popular use of electric vehicles. To promote cost reduction, MITI has compiled five standard specifications for batteries and chargers. First, concerning lead (Pb) batteries: Dimensions and nominal voltage are not set. What has been standardized is voltage regulation, which has been set at 80 - 140% of nominal voltage. Second, concerning communication protocol between charge stand and electric vehicle: When the charger is inserted, seven control signals are to be sent from the electric vehicle to the charger. They include signals to start or stop charging, whether the charger connector is connected properly, etc. Third, concerning the charger connector: At this time, contact type connection has been made the standard. The method of charging without contact by using electromagnetic guidance, as proposed by General Motors Corporation of the United States, has not been addressed. It is possible that both methods will become standard in the United States. MITI also set standards for charger and charge stand, but the details have not been released. The Japan Electric Vehicle Association plans to compile the standards in a book that will be published in January 1994. Table 1: Candidates for Electric Vehicle Storage Battery Closed Type Pb Battery Most Likely for Fall 1997 At present, the open type Pb batteries installed in electric vehicles that are converted gasoline vehicles need maintenance such as electrolytic solution replenishment. ``We cannot ask the general consumer to use the vehicle under such conditions,'' says the Japan Storage Battery Company. Battery manufacturers are working to develop a closed type Pb battery, and already have mounted one in an electric vehicle for experimental purposes. Many battery manufacturers think that this closed type Pb battery is ``the most likely candidate for the electric vehicle battery that will appear in the fall of 1997.'' This is because, while its weight energy density of about 30 to 35 Wh/kg is low and its cycle life of around 400 cycles is short, it is a ``balanced battery'' with high safety and reliability, according to the Japan Storage Battery Company. Nevertheless, since this energy density limits the use of electric vehicles, it is not good enough to keep up with the California regulation. The distance traveled per charge of the existing closed type Pb battery, when loaded with about 200 kg and operated over 40 km of level ground, is about 75 km. At this rate, it can only be used when the distance to be traveled per day is known in advance, such as by dispatched freight delivery vehicles, trash collection vehicles, or vehicles used for commuting when one way is under 30 km. Says Matsushita Battery Industrial Company, ``The 2% minimum probably can be met by using the close type Pb storage battery in the first year under the new regulation, 1998, by selling to a limited market. From 1999 and thereafter, however, sales beyond those to a limited market will be needed, and that would be tough to do with the closed type Pb battery. The automakers say they want the distance traveled per charge to be at least 160 km.'' That is why development is underway to improve energy density and cycle life. Goals for improvement by 1997 are 45 Wh/kg weight energy density and a cycle life of 1,000 cycles. Hopes Pinned to Ni-MH Battery However, even if these goals are achieved, the closed type Pb battery will not reach the energy density required by the automakers. That is why work is being done to develop advanced batteries with higher energy density than the closed type Pb battery. There are many candidates. These include the Ni-based Ni-Cd battery and nickel-hydrogen battery, the Li-based lithium ion battery that has started to be used recently in portable equipment, and Na-based batteries. All the advanced batteries carry unresolved problems, however, and none can be put to practical use right away. The most hope is being pinned on the Ni-based battery. Even now, its weight energy density is about 60 Wh/kg, about double that of the closed type Pb battery, and it meets the requirements of the automakers in output density and cycle life as well. Expectations are especially strong in the United States. The United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC), formed mainly by U.S. automakers, is concentrating research on the nickel-hydrogen battery with a view toward 1997. The battery will be developed by the Ovonic Battery Company of the United States (see Figure 3 [omitted]). In Japan, research is being done by the Furukawa Battery Company, Matsushita Battery Industrial Company and Sanyo Electric Company. However, battery manufacturers who cite the closed type Pb battery as the best candidate for the vehicle to be presented in 1997 cite the high cost of the nickel-hydrogen battery as a problem. Says a certain battery manufacturer, ``It may be almost double the weight energy density as the Pb battery, but it is three to four times the cost.'' It also has problems with reliability. Temperature rises in the battery during charging and discharging, which shortens its charge/discharge cycle life. ``Research on suppressing heat is needed. It does not meet the requirements fully yet,'' says Matsushita Battery. The Ideal Li-Based Battery in 10 Years Battery manufacturers that see the close type Pb battery as the best with which to start also see the Li-based battery as the advanced battery that will replace the closed type Pb battery. Manufacturers that see the nickel-hydrogen battery as promising also predict that the Li-based battery will succeed the nickel-hydrogen battery. The attraction of the Li-based battery is its high energy density. There is no other material that can be used for a secondary battery that would raise energy density higher than lithium. It can raise weight energy density to about 180 Wh/kg. Calculated in terms of distance traveled per charge, this is 340 km. When realized, it can be expected to perform on a par with a gasoline vehicle. It will be well into the future before actual use of the Li-based battery. ``It probably will be realized in 10 years, not in this century,'' says Thomas W. Evernham, senior vice president of the U.S. firm Delco Electronics, which is responsible for the motor and battery used in the electric car ``Impact'' that was developed by the General Motors Corporation of the United States. Many Japanese battery manufacturers share that view. Japanese research on the Li-based battery began in FY92 in the ``dispersion type battery power storage technology'' project, a 10-year project under the New Sunshine Project. The Li-based battery is a long-term R&amp;D them for USABC as well. A Mountain of Problems with Li-Based Battery R&amp;D has only just begun on the Li-based battery and there are a mountain of problems. First, serial/parallel connection of multiple cells is difficult. When multiple cells with dispersed capacity are connected, some cells become over-charged or over-discharged. As a result, the battery electrolyte, an organic solvent, may leak out and ignite. It is said that in the future, the electric vehicle will need around 200 to 300V output voltage. If lithium ion secondary batteries with 3.6V output are used, this would mean a serial connection of almost 100 cells. Parallel connection will be necessary to gain capacity. At present, only three parallel connections of three-cell serial connections has been achieved even for portable equipment. Moreover, large cells with multiple A capacity have yet to be manufactured. Work is being done to develop a lithium secondary battery that uses a solid electrolyte instead of an organic solvent electrolytic solution in order to avoid the danger of fire or explosion. Use of a solid electrolyte will increase safety. However, this makes it difficult to achieve large capacity, and it also has less output density. Specific Uses of Na-S Battery Possible R&amp;D also is proceeding on advanced batteries other than nickel-hydrogen and Li-based batteries. Each one has serious problems in practical application, however, and would have difficulty in replacing the Pb battery as the most popular battery. The Na-based battery is under intense development in Germany. Because its operating temperature is high (350C), it must be heated before use. Once it cools down, it takes time before it is heated up again. ``It is not for the Sunday driver who drives only once a week, but it probably can be used for vehicles that run every day and can maintain the necessary temperature, such as delivery vehicles,'' says the Yuasa Corporation. Another problem is that experiments cannot be conducted on this battery in Japan. There is a legal restriction in the Fire Services Law that prohibits the loading of sodium and sulfur together over a specified quantity. However, an advantage of the Na-based battery, according to the Yuasa Corporation, is that ``The 350C operating temperature ensures that there will be no output density drops or deterioration of life of the battery due to the cold.'' Furthermore, the weight energy density of the Na-S battery is 100 Wh/kg, almost triple that of the Pb battery. Resources are abundant, also. Thus the Swiss firm Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) is working on the Na-S battery and AEG Anglo America AG, with the backing of the German firm Daimler-Benz, is working on an Na-NiCl battery (the zebra battery). Daimler-Benz, BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke) and Volkswagen already have test manufactured electric vehicles in which these batteries have been installed, and have tested them on public roads. As for the Ni-Cd battery, which is widely used for portable equipment, limited cadmium resources is a problem. Deposits contain only enough cadmium for about 30 million electric vehicles. Other Ni-based batteries are the Ni-Fe and Ni-Zn-based batteries. Both have serious problems. The Ni-Fe battery cannot be sealed and therefore requires electrolyte replenishment and other maintenance. The Ni-Zn battery has high energy density, but is short-lived. Regulation To Be Reviewed in 1994 ``The current situation resembles the one in 1973,'' says a major storage battery maker. In 1973, legislation that strengthened emissions regulations was promulgated in California, and automakers were forced to respond. Japanese automakers met these regulations, but U.S. automakers were unable to do so, and enforcement was postponed for one year. It is possible that this time as well, enforcement may be postponed if advanced batteries cannot be developed by 1998. It also is possible that the many hybrid cars that were exhibited at the recent Tokyo Motor Show may initially be approved in place of non-polluting vehicles. The recent legislation is reviewed every two years, and the next review will be in 1994.

            "text": "Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] Japanese automakers are groping in the dark for the right stance to take on development. Unable to read market changes, the new cars introduced after making thorough preparations are even doing poorly. The Tokyo Motor Show that will open on the 23d will symbolize the distress of the Japanese automakers. The Tokyo Motor Show has welcomed its 30th anniversary; 352 companies from 15 nations will participate and more than 2 million people are expected to attend, making it the world's largest motor show, but this time the feeling of a gala festival will not exist for Japanese automakers. Change From Elegance to Plain Concept Cars. All Firms Talk of \"the Future Being in Practicality\" According to an executive at Mazda, whose concept car exhibition consisted of only one hydrogen engine car, the aim of the show was \"to have people see as many cars for sale on the market as possible and tie that to sales.\" This idea was held in common with other companies as well. Says Yutaka Kume, Nissan Motor Chairman, the Motor Show has gone from a festival of dream cars abundantly endowed with the latest technology to an \"opportunity for restoring new car sales.\" A serious slump in sales is threatening to significantly alter the purpose of the show. However, even the idea of an opportunity to expand sales could end in failure if things stay as they are. Behind that is the change in consumer needs. Honda Motor Company Vice President Hiroyuki Yoshino puts it as follows: \"Previously the car was the personification of dreams. However, the domestic market has entered a mature period, and there are increasing numbers of consumers who clearly think of the car as a tool the way people do in Europe and the United States.\" Customers will no longer go along with the idea up to now of making cars higher performance, comfortable, and elegant. The \"plainness\" of all the company concept cars exhibited at the Motor Show was the manifestation of trying to anticipate this change in needs. Up to and including the previous show (in 1991), numerous concept cars were displayed with the latest technologies, novel styling, and competing dazzling elegance, but this time such qualities were completely subdued. Instead, what stood out were concept cars that used gasoline substitutes and which stressed the single point of practicality. Among the latter were two cars exhibited by Toyota Motor and Nissan based on the absolutely identical idea of \"having interior space rivaling that of a large car, but with the car size and fuel consumption of a small car.\" The pudgy appearance could not be called attractive even as an empty compliment, but the two companies both insist that \"in the future this type of thoroughly rationalized car will become mainstream.\" However, the true feelings of Japanese automakers do not welcome such a change. Inexpensive, compact, and practical were once characteristics of Japanese cars, but that is no longer the case. Since size increased and every conceivable type of new technology continued to be piled on during the bubble period, cars are no longer either inexpensive or compact. It is pointed out that they are excessively equipped and it has also become doubtful whether they are practical. Price Difference Between U.S. Cars: Severe Cost Reductions Make Development Teams Feel Powerless In January 1994 Chrysler will introduce the Japanese car killer \"Neon,\" the focus of much attention, into the North American market. It is expected that the minimum price of this small passenger car will be about $9,000. A passenger car with engine displacement of 2,000 cc, its price at about 1 million yen defies the conventional wisdom of the Japanese automakers. Such things as power windows, and other equipment not regarded very highly by small car customers have been decidedly cut out, and it is said that, compared to a Japanese car of the same class, it has reduced the total number of parts by 10 percent. There are critics, such as Honda President Nobuhiko Kawamoto, who says, \"The Neon is a car solely in earnest pursuit of affordability. It will be necessary to monitor the situation a bit longer to make an accurate assessment of its reliability, among other things.\" One thing for certain, however, is that it has placed a big gap between the Japanese makers and the Big Three in terms of price competitiveness. Lamenting his own company's disposition toward high costs, Nissan President Yoshifumi Tsuji says, \"No matter how hard we try, a car under 1.5 million yen will not generate a surplus. It is like producing it merely to maintain the plant's rate of operation.\" Fixed costs such as personnel expenses and repayment expenses which soared during the bubble period have become encumbrances, and their constitution is such that they cannot turn a profit just by the manufacture of inexpensive cars. Of course, they are desperately trying to cut costs by doing things like using parts in common with other companies and value analysis (VA), but just trying to reduce prices by an accumulation of small devices naturally has limitations. Confronted by the double punch of the strong yen and the sudden change in the Big Three's way of making cars aggravates a feeling of ineffectiveness of efforts to reduce costs in units of sen [1/10 of a yen]. The drop in morale of the development teams is also a big problem. Recently, most of the new cars put on sale had to undergo a sudden price revision in the course of development. This is due to the need to hold down the sales price even a little amid the strengthening cost orientation of consumers. For this reason, at the time that development work gained considerable ground, they were ordered to use parts in common with other models and eliminate equipment. A technician at one manufacturer says, \"Because top managers say this thing or that thing is unnecessary or wasteful, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction in development.\" \"Sales Change Just by Appearance. Are Consumers Really Emphasizing Practicality?\" Companies are also becoming shocked when unit sales drop radically once the new car effect dissipates several months after the beginning of sales, and this is amplifying the bewilderment of development teams. In August Toyota did a minor change to its luxury passenger car \"Crown,\" but within the industry there were many who described it as \"virtually a full model change.\" Ordinarily, a minor change is confined to small alterations such as making improvements to parts, the addition of variations, etc. However, the Crown received major modifications. It received the \"major surgery\" of having its front grille, bumper, and rear area remodeled so that its rounded styling was returned to a sharper cornered version that is closer to the older type of Crown. The Crown has been one of Toyota's moneymakers, ranking right alongside the \"Mark II.\" However, going into this year, its sales performance dropped to far less than the monthly target of 17,000 units, and continued to be extreme sluggish at a monthly average of just over 9,000 units. The old angular style Crown maintained a respectable level of sales even when it was at the end of its model period. Therefore, Toyota decided to bring it closer to the old style which had enjoyed such a favorable reception. September sales had recovered to just over 14,000 units, so the situation has improved, but the analysis of an executive at a rival maker is that \"this is evidence that even Toyota, which is hailed as the representative of the `market in' type firm, has started having difficulty getting a handle on the current market.\" The same sort of phenomenon can be seen with Nissan's top luxury car \"Infiniti Q45.\" In a minor change in June, a grille was newly installed in front. As a result, unit sales which had dropped at one point to about 80 per month increased suddenly to 699 units (in September). The Infiniti has been using the rare grilleless appearance as a point of appeal to consumers as a luxury car. However, with the extremely sluggish sales, it changed its tune. Even though sales may increase, the distress will not diminish. One company official complains that \"for sales to change this much just by changing the appearance, one loses confidence in whether consumers now are really valuing practicality.\" Sales of Honda's \"Domani,\" the small passenger car it began selling in November 1992, are also lethargic at about half the monthly sales target of 3,000 units. The Domani was the first small car in Japan to offer a driver's side air bag as standard equipment in an appeal to safety considerations. However, Vice President Yoshino recognizes the mistaken reading of the market, saying, \"Many customers say they don't need air bags and that if the car's price could be reduced by the cost of the air bags they would buy it.\" Firms understand the direction of change in the market viewed in the long term toward inexpensive and practicality, but are unable to get a reading of the speed of that change. Moreover, they have developed an excessively high-cost constitution to be able to respond to change. That state of affairs has caused Japanese automakers to lose confidence and is causing them to stray off course. Nissan and Mazda have fallen into deficit and there are rumors that even Toyota will have an operating deficit in the coming first half, so all firms are suffering from rapidly worsening earnings. Because it is a climate that does not permit failure, new car development will be forced to strengthen its protective stance. This motor show will be opened in a state of unprecedented distress. Will the festival that extolls the future of automobiles ironically become a stage where \"the curtain will be closed on dreams\"?"

Before leaving Abu Dhabi earlier today, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir stressed that Kuwait would not attend any Arab summit conference that may be convened to bring about Arab reconciliation unless the causes of Arab disputes had been removed first. In a statement to some Arab correspondents, he said that Kuwait's stance vis-a-vis Arab reconciliation had not changed, stressing that reconciliation may be discussed once the main cause that has created the Arab dispute had been resolved. The first deputy prime minister and foreign minister stressed that there were no differences in perception among GCC states with regards to reconciliation. He pointed out that the GCC states' stance emphasized the need for any reconciliation to be preceded by confronting the wrongdoings committed. In his statement, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir stressed that the GCC was the mainstay of security in the region. He said that agreement was reached at the Riyadh summit to develop the strength of the Peninsula Shield force and increase the number of its troops in order for it to become a shield for protecting the region's countries.

            "text": "Language: Italian Article Type:BFN [Interview with Alberto Meomartini, managing director of the Italian national gas corporation, by Fabio Pavesi; place and date not given: \"Methane Candidates Itself as the Sourcer for the Year 2000\" -- first six paragraphs are L'IMPRESA AMBIENTE introduction] [Text] Since there are abundant resources of natural gas and it is a versatile fuel, it is now in first place in the Italian energy portfolio. Nearly 50 billion cubic meters are consumed and this covers 25 percent of the national energy requirement. It holds a place of honor after petroleum, that has been won over 20 years of continual progress. The demand has in fact increased to its present level from 13 billion cubic meters in 1970. Further leaps ahead are foreseen for the immediate future. According to forecasts made by SNAM [National Gas Pipeline Company], at the turn of the century about 75 billion cubic meters should be available to meet the domestic requirement. The growth in the use of this source of energy has been determined by its characteristics of flexibility and high efficiency. It should not be forgotten that the environmental variable, which has become ever more important, has been one of the factors that has contributed to both the success and the multiplicity of uses of natural gas. In fact the combustion of methane liberates neither sulfur dioxide nor particles and assists in reducing (for the same amount of energy used) the emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. Although three quarters of the consumption of methane in Italy is destined to civil and industrial use, the 10 years from 1980 to 1990 have seen the use of methane for the generation of electricity triplicate, and this is the sector where the environmental advantages of the fuel should open up further new opportunities for development. The opportunities for the future use of methane in the road transport sector should also be stressed. Last July Fiat and SNAM signed an agreement for the perfection of an engine that is exclusively powered by methane. The agreement, which provides for an initial funding of 10 billion lire, assigns the definition of the logistic and organizational aspects of the operation to the corporation that forms part of the ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] group. The medium-term goal of the operation is that a quota of vehicles for personal and public transport should have methane engines. In short, there are many initiatives underway that will lead to a further increase in the demand for gas. L'IMPRESA AMBIENTE discussed these subjects with SNAM Managing Director Alberto Meomartini. [Pavesi] Let us start with the methane automobile. The largest national producer of automobiles, and the public corporation that essentially manages methane throughout Italy, have formed an alliance to create a revolutionary engine. Is the gasoline era coming to an end? [Meomartini] No, without a doubt. There is no risk that gasoline will become obsolete, neither at present nor in the future. It would be better to say that from now on methane-powered vehicles will no longer be confined to the realms of utopia. This is the real meaning of the agreement that we have stipulated with Fiat. It is the signal that there are spaces in elected areas, in this case urban traffic, where the use of methane could provide an excellent concrete answer to environmental problems. In fact, the combustion of methane means increased efficiency and therefore energy saving and contained levels of polluting emissions, such as in the case of carbon monoxide, or no emission, as for sulfur dioxide and particles. [Pavesi] Is this valid for all road vehicles? [Meomartini] Theoretically, yes. However, it is necessary to go ahead gradually. It is clear that for automobiles and private transport in general, there are some rigid elements that are not easy to overcome, such as refueling, and autonomy over a distance. The agreement with Fiat focuses on public transport, starting with taxis and company fleets as far as automobiles are concerned, and also buses, of course. Iveco already produces buses that are exclusively powered by methane. We do not think that it is as important to talk about large numbers today as it is to talk of the high symbolic value that is behind this initiative. And even if we should quantify the phenomena, let us not forget that public transport has noteworthy incidence on the global level of pollution within the city. [Pavesi] I suppose that the costs of these prototypes are not competitive. [Meomartini] The cost of the vehicles will initially be higher. If however we look into all the dynamics of costs-benefits we discover that this is a half truth. On the other side of the balance we must put the high energy efficiency of the methane engine and the low cost of this fuel, as well as, obviously, the lower costs for the environment, that we should all be taking into account at last. They are all positive variables within the complete management plan. At Ravenna, where five methane-powered buses are already circulating, the verdicts of the administration and the population on this first experiment are more than flattering. [Pavesi] Are you working on anything else? [Meomartini] A series of contacts with the public administrations are underway. We are thinking of an agreement between Iveco and SNAM and the Emilia Romagna Region on a significant substitution, within a specified time, of the entire fleet of buses in circulation. The biggest mistake in this case as in other cases is to think that public opinion is the only retarding force against the introduction of innovative products onto the market, such as methane-powered vehicles. Results are only obtained by starting with a constant comparison in which the public sector party, who is the real manager of the initiative, is not left alone. [Pavesi] Let us come to the traditional uses of methane. How much has the environment contributed to the increase in consumption of this energy source? [Meomartini] If, by the environment, we do not only mean minor pollution, but also the saving of resources, I would say that this variable has had a very important influence on the development of its uses. In the past natural gas was often considered and used only as a substitute for other fossil sources. In the course of the years, research has produced a great improvement in efficiency and energy output. And this is a plus that has been appreciated more and more. If we add to this a combustion process that produces levels of pollution that are lower than those of other energy sources, the circle is completed. [Pavesi] What form will the scene take in the year 2000? How will natural gas compare with other energy sources? [Meomartini] Italy has reserves of over 300 billion cubic meters and produces between 16 and 17 billion cubic meters a year, which forms the basis, this quantity not having varied for many years. We are counting on being able to increase the flow of gas coming from abroad, that today accounts for about 70 percent of the total requirement. This, thanks to an increase in the availability of gas from Algeria following the installation of a second gas pipeline across the Mediterranean that will allow an increase in the supply from the present 13-14 billion cubic meters to 19 billion cubic meters in 1995, which becomes 23 billion when the gas purchased directly by ENEL [Italian Natini] The development of the consumption of natural gas is a worldwide characteristic. However, we cannot imagine that our projects can grow without limits. The entire energy market must have its own equilibrium, represented by balanced relationships between the various sources. Methane is to be used where it is economical and technologically more convenient. In this balanced view, the greatest obstacle is that of fiscal politics, which through the multiplication of levies, weighs heavily and therefore penalizes. Another problem that arises during the laying of gas pipelines is that of the environmental norms. We are still not formally subject to an evaluation of the environmental impact. Despite this, the network of norms in our country is particularly complicated and bureaucratic, so much so that sometimes it really slows work down. It is a pity, because we in SNAM have a great and consolidated tradition of environmental conservation. It is enough to think of the gas pipeline for importation across countries such as Austria, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland, that as far as environmental severity is concerned are definitely second to none."

What is true is that our present power generation is dirty and inefficient, but this is changing. Many of us have been working to develop an advanced power source called a 'Fuel Cell', which instead of burning fuels, converts them electrochemically, cleanly, quietly and efficiently. We already have, in Japan and some European countries, fuel cell power-generating plants with efficiency more than 80 per cent and minimal pollutants. Fuel cells are also being evaluated for transport use, where they are expected to be at least twice as efficient in overall energy use as their internal combustion engined counterparts, while causing, according to the US Department of Energy, only 1 per cent of the pollution. The fuel cell is a proven technology, first developed in the UK by British scientists, and it has the potential to make electric transport the most clean and efficient of all possible in the near future.

What are your feelings after having seen the situation in the field? [Claes] I cannot hide my concern at the present political vacuum, an economy in free fall, and the fact that the conditions which would permit the implementation of the Arusha accords have still not been met. But we cannot wait any longer: All the parties which feel able to participate in implementing these accords should do so, even if they leave others to join them later. Otherwise, I fear that Rwanda may move toward an almost structural confrontation between the ethnic groups. [Braeckman] You have issued warnings and threatened to suspend cooperation. Have you been heard? [Claes] My comments have not been followed by results, that is the least you can say: While I was in the country a political leader was assassinated, and I know that a lot of arms are held by the civilian population. I see no other solution than the implementation of the Arusha accords, even if a great deal will remain to be done after that. The two armies must be merged, a large part of those bearing arms must be demobilized, and an emergency plan must be drawn up for the economy. This too will require funding. [Braeckman] How do you view the recent events in Burundi, and more massacres in Bujumbura? [Claes] It is clear that the Army does not accept the power- sharing formula which emerged after the election of President Ndadaye and which was reproduced when his successor was appointed. [Braeckman] Following the putsch there were calls for Belgian military intervention in order to avert further clashes, were there not? [Claes] That is true. We were asked to send 2,000 soldiers, but it was clear the Army did not agree. There was a risk of violent confrontation. It was subsequently decided to send in a stabilization force consisting of troops designated by the Organization of African Unity. Belgium was ready to make a financial contribution of US$2 million to this force. But even this, the dispatch of 180 men, was not acceptable to the Army. There was then talk of sending in 65 officers responsible for health and hygiene tasks, which was by no means a stabilization force. But the Burundian Army considered that even this was humiliating. During my talks with the government it became clear that the authorities want to reorganize the Army, they want to separate off the purely military activities of the gendarmerie and create a sort of republican guard. Belgium's help was requested, but if we now decide to restore military cooperation with Burundi, I wonder what kind of welcome our experts will receive and how we can take their suggestions into account. [Braeckman] Belgium is still interested in Central Africa. But is it not one of the last remaining countries which is? [Claes] This very morning I explained to the UN secretary-general's representative for Africa that there was a danger of countries in the industrialized world becoming disheartened over Africa, of turning their backs on it, if the Africans themselves did not give minimum guarantees of stability in order to allow a fruitful return to cooperation. You know that within the European Union, Belgium and France are the only two remaining champions of the African continent. It is only the Maghreb on the one hand and South Africa on the other which are still considered to be of interest. I must also point out that 85 percent of the Belgian cooperation budget is still destined for Africa. This cooperation must not become impossible. [Braeckman] Turning now to Zaire, does the Western troika still exist? [Claes] Together with Paris and Washington, we will accept the result of the current parliamentary sessions. We obviously recognize the new structure (HCR-PT, High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament), as it is the result of accords negotiated by the Zairians themselves. Negotiated, but not yet signed. Together with our partners, we support any prime minister drawn from this new Zairian Parliament: For us, it is not a question of individuals, but of principle. The HCR-PT is for us the new source of legality in Zaire. But I repeat that solid guarantees will be required before any further international aid is available."

Near Beijing Airport, Lienhua Electronics--China's largest integrated circuit plant--shares honors with arriving and departing tourists. During 1992, the 200 percent growth of the Taiwan information business' investment in the mainland far surpassed its investment in other areas. But investment in Taiwan itself was less than 20 percent. No longer is the investment in traditional industries like shoes, umbrellas, and brief cases. Even scientific and technical industries on which Taiwan pins its future hopes have rapidly become infected with the mainland craze. Relations between the two sides of the strait have entered a new stage of change from the quantitative to the qualitative. Separate interests of the scalene triangle made up of Taiwan firms, Taiwan, and the mainland differ. Is Taiwan firms opening up of the opposite shore more quickly and more deeply just an expansion of Taiwan businesses operating territory or might it put pressure on Taiwan's living space? At a time when the whole world is advancing along the road of regional economic integration, in the long-range picture that Taiwan economic decision makers portray for getting enterprises to put down firm roots and home and develop and grow elsewhere, science and technology industries are to receive the baton and drive ahead in replacing old industries with new ones. They are completely confident about Taiwan's scientific and technical industries for good reason. Taiwan's information and electronics industries have truly won a share in the global division of labor system. Major information firms in Europe and the Americas have recently been scrambling to improve their ties with Taiwan manufacturers. This has made Taiwan a world class manufacturing site. Its fixed mount scanners, personal computer mainframes, and its monitoring devices rank first in the world. Through the transformation of time and space, the real and the bogus may be turned upside down all of a sudden. Were they to fly less that a hour's flight distant from Taiwan to Shenzhen and look at the blending and transformation of the scientific and technical industries of both side of the Strait, they would certainly revise with extreme vigilance the strong convictions they formerly held. It is ten past noon, and the narrow Shanchuan Lane in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone [SEZ] is bustling. Women employees on lunch break are shampooing their hair beside Lutian Street. In the bamboo fence-decorated restaurant, Teng Hung-lin, who hails from Taitung, and who is wearing a pair of black jeans, high top athletic shoes, and a white T-shirt, is eating some spicy Sichuan dandan noodles. He is talking about the monthly output of 200,000 computer mainframes: \"My output is now more than everyone's.\" Laughingly, he said, \"On lunar new year's eve, we gave a party for 50 tables full of guests.\" It is hard to believe that this factory could be so extraordinarily brave. By comparison with most Taiwan air-conditioned plants, the plant that this Taiwan trader has leased in Shenzhen looks for all the world like an old flour mill. The only thing in the plant's original color cement wall office that makes one think about modern science and technology is the newest NEC script writer color computer. \"Our people run back and forth to Taiwan frequently. It is very convenient,\" Teng says. \"I was the one who got this plant going,\" Teng Hung-lin acknowledges. The successful experiences that Taiwan's information electronics industry worked out over a period of many years have been moved lock, stock, and barrel to the mainland. They have been combined here with the mainland's copious manpower to produce newer competition. Taiwan firms have a lock on the source of computer chip components. They control things coming and going. Typically, Teng Hung-lin has also invested in a Taiwan chip designing company. The computer chip sockets that Taiwan entrepreneurs have recently produced, Teng Hung-lin is also developing in his own building in Shenzhen. \"I can save two New Taiwan dollars on each one,\" he says shaking the part he is holding in his hand. In order to meet quality requirements for precision production, Taiwan firms have brought in NT$2 million robots that accurately bond small parts to the surface of circuit boards. Teng Hung-lin even managed to save this NT$2 million investment by simply training manual operators, using manpower to counter machines. \"Now I depend on those six pair of hands,\" he said happily. In the western suburbs of Shanghai, just a one-hour flight north of Shenzhen, is what Chou Cheng-jung forecast in 1959 like Teng Hung-lin. Although one out of every two monitors in the world were made in Taiwan in 1992, \"by the end of 1992, Taiwan will be unable to make any monochrome computer monitors.\" Chou Cheng-jung, who was in charge of Taiwan Ch'uan-nao Electronics' European market, has now shifted his base to Shanghai where he is cooperating with the Shanghai Electron Tube Plant in turning out monitors. People travel back and forth in a steady stream from south and north in the mainland, exploring avenues for Taiwan's information electronics industry. Not only have power supply devices, monitors, and mainframes gradually become production staples, but a computer software industry, which Taiwan has long wanted to develop vigorously but which has not been successful in Taiwan, is now beginning to be developed on the mainland by the Taiwan information industry using factory-like quantity production methods. Even cooperation on high definition television (HDTV), which is still in the developmental state, is being discussed between Taiwan and the mainland. Transfers Abroad Too Rapid! Zhou Muchang [0719 1970 2490], director of the Chinese mainland's Ministry of Electronics Computer Research Center, said with a smile:\"Between 70 and 80 percent of Taiwan's more than 400 important information concerns are cooperating with the mainland.\" This tide has greatly reversed the direction of flow of Taiwan capital and technology. Southeast Asia has been the region in which the information electronics industry has invested heavily. During the previous two or three years, Taiwan had been the largest foreign investor in ASEAN countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, and its investment in electronics-related industries there was most dazzling. During the past year, however, the overall amount of Taiwan's investment in southeast Asia has fallen off sharply. Statistics from the information electronics industry alone provide a strong indication of this. The Southeast Asia fever that flourished for a time has given way to a mainland China fever. \"This is really a cause for concern. The shift abroad is really too fast,\" said Li Ta-wei [2621 1129 5898] of the Statistical Commission's Market Information Center, who is responsible for keeping track of Taiwan entrepreneurs' investment abroad. Pointing at the figures, he said, \"In Southeast Asia, it is only a little more than 20 percent of normal growth, but on the mainland, it has been a growth of several hundred percent.\" Even though the mainland is currently unable to compete with Taiwan on relatively high quality products, and although most Taiwan entrepreneurs predict that Taiwan still has a three to five year lead, the mainland's information electronics industry has recently shown itself to be on the rise. During the first half of 1993 alone, mainland information industry exports increased 200 percent over the same period during the previous year. The personal computer internal sales market for the year also caught up with Taiwan's average 350,000 units. The China mainland general manager of the American Hewlett-Packard Computer Corporation, Cheng Tianzong [4453 1131 4912], reminded that when looking at a competitor, \"you must not always look at his shortcomings; you should look at the way in which he is changing.\" Entry Into an Entirely New Stage When traditional industries such as shoe, umbrella, and Christmas decoration industries went ashore on the other side of the Strait one after another, Taiwan said complacently: This is an elimination of industries that is inevitable as the economy escalates. Scientific and technical industries will receive the baton and carrying on the task of pulling up the industrial level. Today, however, even scientific and technical industries can hardly escape catching the mainland craze. This is fully demonstrated by economic and trade relations between the two sides of the Strait entering an entirely new phase of change from quantity and the spurring of qualitative change. The speed and the number of scientific and technical industries that have surged into the mainland has increased tremendously. This is bound to hurt Taiwan. Once the factories that Taiwan firms rushed to build go into operation, will the large number of scientific and technical enterprises that have a blood relationship with Taiwan and whose mainland personnel are well-versed in production skills expand the operating area of Taiwan enterprises, or will they turn around and put pressure on Taiwan's living space? Zhang Jichun [1728 1807 5028], who is in charge of economic relations and trade in Shanghai's Taiwan Office, and who studied biochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, showed that chemistry remains his basic profession when he said, \"What is going on is a chemical compounding reaction between both sides of the Strait.\" Once a chemical reaction occurs, an entirely new material results. A return to the original state is impossible. Once economic relations and trade between both sides of the Strait have been largely meshed, a new stage will come into being. When they were in Taiwan, each increase in production that Taiwan firms made was a contribution to the country. The interests of the government and enterprises were identical. That time has passed never to return. Henceforth, economic and trade relations across the Taiwan Strait will no longer be in a straight line between two sides, but a scalene triangle among Taiwan, the mainland, and Taiwan firms, each one of which will use different means to attain its own interests. Taiwan firms must strive to make their own businesses prosper; Taiwan must maintain its own security and open new room for maneuver; and the mainland will be intent on acquiring Taiwan's economic resources and experience while simultaneously moderately extending sovereignty over Taiwan. In the new triangular relationship, the three parties will explore and experiment in an effort to find ideal long-term and near-term relations. Looked at solely in terms of the development of scientific and technical industries, Taiwan and the mainland really need each other. The mainland needs Taiwan because scientists and technicians on the mainland, which is able to launch artificial satellites and nuclear bombs, are truly unfamiliar with large scale microcomputer production and sales. Zhou Muchang, the minister of Electronics Industry admitted that despite having spent a large amount of money on computer technology to build 21 production lines, the Chinese Communists were never able to establish an internationally competitive industrial base. \"Taiwan's success is distinctive. China needs to study it, but complete imitation is not possible, because times have changed.\" Zhou Muchang did not try to hide the Chinese Communists hope of using Taiwan to guide and build its personal computer industry: \"Technology is changing too rapidly today. We need time to develop, and the best way is to cooperate with firms abroad like Taiwan's.\" However, Taiwan's scientific and technical enterprises must also narrow the distance with the mainland. A Copious Manpower and Technology Market Hsu Hsiang-sheng [1775 3276 3932], the person responsible for Acer on the mainland who went to Beijing to set up a base in April 1993, affirmed in his office that no one dared underestimate the market potential of the mainland. \"If Acer is to become a world class computer firm, it will have to come to the mainland.\" An ordinary single occupancy room on the eleventh floor of Beijing's Olympic Building is both Hsu Hsiang-sheng's office and bedroom. An even more important pressure driving Taiwan entrepreneurs toward the mainland is unremitting and more varied competition at home and abroad. Some of the scientific and technical entrepreneurs arriving in the mainland receive a respect that operators of industries in Taiwan are not accorded. Yingyeda [phonetic], which produces computers and script writer computers has long worked to no avail to recruit personnel in Taiwan to meet its professional needs. \"We spent more than NT$2 million a month on newspaper ads, but we received no more than 10 letters in reply,\" assistant general manager Lai Chen-hsing [6351 2182 5281] reflected. Finally, Yingyeda decided to set up a site in Shanghai where it could make use of the manpower supply network that Shanghai's 58 institutions of higher education had set up. Lai Chen-hsing also remembered having spent a little more than NT$60 to join the Shanghai Talent Recruitment Association and finding 25 people at one time. Today, Yingyeda is using more than 200 technical personnel in Shanghai, each one of which has a computer to write computer, telephone, and electronic dictionary software just like the software factories in Japan. When Yingyeda built its plant, the chairman of the board, Yeh Kuo-hui [0673 0948 6540] personally planned the plant site. He went to Shanghai at least three times monthly to superintend. In addition, since Shanghai listed construction of the Yingyeda plant as a key construction project, it was given full local support in the same way as the subway and the Yangpu Bridge. A seven story factory building was completed within 11 months. The concrete gains of Taiwan firms from the use of the mainland may be easily quantified, but the effect on Taiwan as a whole is difficult to estimate. Li Ta-wei of the Statistical Council warns: \"The mainland's finest production technology is now in the hands of Taiwan firms.\" Under guidance and direction from Taiwan firms, the mainland's information electronics industry climate is bound to improve over time. He said, \"Taiwan depends on an industrial network. If it moves out of Taiwan, Taiwan's advantage will not last for long.\" Drawn by Taiwan firms, this network is gradually moving into the mainland. Not only has production of all computer components such as power supplies and keyboard been moved to the mainland, but Taiwan's parts importing and supply firms have also began vigorous development of the mainland market. The mainland's first goal is to hold fast to Taiwan firms that land there. Now that Philipps and China Kinescope have decided to set up plants on the mainland, the impetus of the mainland's computer monitor industry has recently become greater and greater. Complete Transplant of Industrial System Some firms have adopted the methods of Japan's Toyota Automobile Corporation, completely moving to the mainland upstream and downstream firms. Gyokusei Computer, which owes its rise to mainframe production, has begun to build a complete system in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province. Not only is Gyokusei's mainframe plant in Shenzhen, but it is also producing keyboards and computer cases there. Gyokusei has also moved to the mainland, where it is planning to set up another base, the surface bonding equipment for even the script writer computers that it is making an all out effort to put into production in Taiwan. Remembering when Gyokusei had nearly 1,000 employees in Taiwan a year ago, one observer said, \"Gyokusei used to be one of the world's first three mainframe plants, but today it has fewer than 300 people remaining in Taiwan.\" Not only has Taiwan changed the industrial environment for supporting the mainland, but western nations, which formerly strictly controlled the export of technology to the mainland, have become increasingly liberal recently. In addition, Hong Kong and Chinese firms supply each others needs. The channels through which the mainland obtains components are becoming wider and wider. Saige [phonetic] Electronics Equipment Plaza is a virtual reproduction of Taipei's Kuanghua Market. One businessman said descriptively, \"Once a foreign chip is marketed, Saige has it a week afterward.\" A Taiwan computer mainframe plant official who set up a factory in Guangdong admitted frankly, \" I go through Hong Kong to buy parts. I do not have to have anything to do with Taiwan.\" Island Taiwan's Challenge The biggest sticking point for Taiwan in the current Taiwan trader construction of a network that bridges the Taiwan Strait is how to make a distinction that does not hurt Taiwan firms while still protecting Taiwan. In early November, Minister of Economic Affairs, Chiang Ping-k'un [3068 0014 0981], held a breakfast discussion with Taiwan industrialists. On the advice of industrial concerns, Chiang Ping-k'un agreed to change the way of listing mainland investment projects from those that are government-approved to those that are not government-approved. After discussion within the government, although the Ministry of Economic Affairs countermanded this order, the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, Yang Shih-chien [2799 0013 4873], agreed that the government would gradually decontrol the importation of mainland semi-manufactures. This government announcement meant that in the long contest for economic dominance, the mainland seemed to have pushed another step forward. It was only two weeks before the controversy that Liu Zhentao [0491 7201 3447], director of the Economic Bureau of the China mainland-Taiwan Office emphasized that getting Taiwan to decontrol the importation of mainland semi-manufactures was an economic and trade breakthrough that the Chinese Communists were currently striving to obtain. He acknowledged frankly that this was a Chinese Communist riposte to the \"retain roots in Taiwan\" that Taiwan shouts to the skies. \"I feel that \"retain roots in Taiwan\" is a Taiwan ploy against the mainland,\" Liu Zhentao said. No matter whether retain roots in Taiwan is really a ploy, or whether it is just a slogan, Taiwan firms were successful in getting the importation of mainland semi-manufactures decontrolled. At a time when the whole work is calling for regional economies, the most difficult challenge to island Taiwan may be how to be a good regional partner, and how to be able genuinely to protect its own supreme national interests while being in the regional maelstrom."

            "text": "Language: English Article Type:BFN [Excerpts] Lagos, 7 March (AFP) -- Nigerian military authorities announced Monday [7 March] that they will send observers to joint military manoeuvres involving Beninese and French troops expected to begin the same day in neighbouring Benin. France \"requested us to send observers and the Nigerian Armed Forces decided to send them at the weekend\", defence spokesman General Fred Chijuka told AFP. The military authorities expect a report from the Nigerian observer team sent to witness to military manoeuvres, he added. Nigeria, he said, must have been requested to send observers to clear any lingering doubts about the aim of the military exercise, especially since France has been accused by Abuja of allying with Yaounde over a current border dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon. The tension between the two countries generated as a result of a dispute over the ownership of Bakassi peninsula has abated and Nigerian military authorities believe that the military manoeuvres might have been planned before now, said Chijuka. [passage omitted] The fact that the military manoeuvres were to start at this moment of conflict between Yaounde and Abuja might be a \"coincidence\", he said. Sunday, press reports here quoted Nigerian officials as being suspicious of the military exercise, describing it as \"a show of might\" at the moment of crisis. \"When they return, our people should be able to tell us\" the exact situation of things, Chijuka said. In another development, the military administrator of one of the states bordering the disputed territory has said Nigeria was making plans to solve refugee problems that may crop up as a result of the conflict. The military administrator of Akwa Ibom state, Colonel Yakubu Bako, said that necessary logistics have been put in place in the state to tackle refugee problem, the official NAN reported late Sunday. \"We are expecting that problem, we have worked out the logistics and submitted it to the Nigeria federal government\", Bako told journalists. Although the state was not having refugee problems at the moment, Bako said he has initiated moves to hold talks with his colleagues in Abia and Cross River, two states neighbouring on Akwa Ibom over the matter. The independent CONCORD newspaper reported Sunday that an average of 300 displaced Nigerians fleeing Cameroon arrive daily in Ikang, a border village in Cross River State. The newspaper report has not been officially confirmed."

It was not immediately clear if the plane was the German-registered Cessna aircraft that disappeared last week shortly before landing at the Alternrhein airstrip near here with 70 kilograms of radioactive caesium-137 aboard. A robot sub would be sent down Wednesday to inspect the wreckage, police said. Geiger counter readings taken near the wreckage Tuesday did not show any increased radiation, police said. The lake supplies drinking water to four million people in northern Switzerland."

            "text": "Language: German Article Type:BFN [Unattributed report: \"Anyone Will Give In\"] [Text] The dark shadow in map square number 3664 reminds one of a gigantic, mutilated insect. One of the trapeze-like wings had broken off, the nose was missing, and in the dull gray water of Lake Constance even a diving robot of the \"Sear Rover\" type could send only diffuse video pictures from 159 meters below the surface of the lake. A two-engine Cessna 425 plane, license number D-IEFW, lay on its back like a helpless beetle. The plane had taken off from Prague shortly after 1800 on the Monday before last [24 January] and had crashed into Lake Constance during a failed landing approach to the Swiss airport of Altenrhein in St. Gallen Canton. In the plane there were professional pilot Rudolf Wirschen, 44, Berlin merchant and hobby flier Josef Rimmele, 54, his partner Klaus Eichler, 53, as well as Czech citizens Iveta Ranetova, 30, and Alena Petrusova, 39. Rimmele's loyal terrier Asta, 8, was also aboard. Lake Constance hides various mysteries. Occasionally, defective small planes, helicopters, or boats sink, their cargo disappearing in the far reaches of the lake. The largest German inland lake has had to swallow a lot, particularly dirt and poison: Year after year, 21,000 tonnes of nitrates, 2,300 tonnes of phosphor, and 800 tonnes of other pollutants, such as lead and zinc, mingle in the water between three countries [Austria, Germany, and Switzerland]. However, what was assumed to lie at the bottom of the lake last week seemed to be far more dangerous: a sinister threat that one could not smell, see, or taste. Reportedly, the Cessna carried at least 70 kg of highly radioactive material called cesium 137. And BILD knew early that Rimmele and Eichler were the \"nuclear traders of the Russian Mafia.\" A clear case: Europe's largest drinking water reservoir, which supplies water to about 4 million people every day, from St. Gallen in Switzerland to far behind Stuttgart, seemed to be in danger. Disaster relief experts worked out emergency plans for the worst possible accident. When the German research submarine \"Iago\" began rescuing the Cessna last Friday afternoon, it had long been determined that the highly poisonous cargo could not have been aboard. In order to shield 70 kg of radioactive cesium 137, which is a by-product of nuclear fission and is used in measurement and control engineering, one needs a lead casing that would weigh four tonnes. The Cessna would not have been able to take off in the first place. The mysterious events playing against the scenery of Lake Constance are an example of contemporary hysteria. They show how uncertain policemen, politicians, and media are because of a new variety of crime: Since the fall of the Wall, poisonous substances and radioactive material from the arsenals of the former East Bloc are being offered on a worldwide, bizarre fleamarket of death. And the danger that emanates from vagrant nuclear material has meanwhile become real. The Federal Office of Criminal Investigations (BKA) in Wiesbaden and the Federal Intelligence Office (BND) in Pullach are warning against the new threat that comes from the East. In an alarming 18-page report to the Chancellor's Office (\"Nuclear Black Market/Nuclear Terrorism\") at the beginning of January, the BND noticed a \"trend toward an escalation of the situation,\" which \"gives\" everyone \"reason for concern.\" For the first time, \"the threshold to high enrichment\" has been \"crossed\" with stolen uranium material. A \"friendly intelligence service\" received a sample of material with a \"degree of enrichment of slightly less than 40 percent.\" This is a step forward on the path toward a nuclear bomb, which needs either plutonium or highly enriched uranium 235 as fissionable material. It is also alarming that, for the fist time, it is not only dictators, but possibly also \"two extreme Islamic fundamentalist associations\" that are trying to obtain access to technical knowledge about nuclear matters. In addition, the confidential BND paper notes that there are \"credible intelligence service findings\" that, in the East, \"individual high-ranking officials from ministries, embassies, industrial enterprises, and research facilities\" are involved in the dubious nuclear deals. All this means crossing a \"threshold of danger.\" BKA experts and intelligence service officials can imagine that further developed nuclear specialities or frightening biological weapons could get into the hands of Western gangs -- a completely new field for blackmailers. \"If this happens,\" BKA chief Hans-Ludwig Zachert predicts, \"any community will give in.\" At the beginning of last year, the Bavarian Land Office of Criminal Investigations alarmed the authorities with a report that a gang of nuclear smugglers had considered blackmail with fissionable material. However, it remained just a plan. In November, a madman threatened that he would destroy the inner cities of Frankfurt, Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich with thermonuclear warheads. He demanded 100 million marks [DM] from the Munich State Lottery Administration. Also, in November, the threatening letter of a \"Bosnian Indignation Front\" turned up, according to BND findings. The hitherto unknown organization wanted to detonate nuclear warheads in four European capital cities, if its political demands for the benefit of Bosnia were not fulfilled. For the time being, the intelligence services still react with relative composure to such threats. According to current knowledge, it can still be ruled out \"that nuclear warheads are indeed available in an uncontrolled manner,\" the BND report says. However, the composure might soon shatter. Individual terror already is one of the achievements of the nuclear age. Not only Western intelligence service officials seem to consider the terrible end of Vladimir Kaplun, 63, as a model case. The manager of a Moscow packaging company died horribly in great pain: Opponents had put a source of radiation in his chair. In the crumbled Soviet empire, where nuclear material \"of all kinds, at least from civilian institutions\" (BND) is available as easily as a handgun in St. Pauli [Hamburg], things like that are happening more often now. In Irkutsk, Siberia, a saboteur wanted to kill two company heads with the same method. The gentlemen noticed in time that they felt bad, and survived. A potential killer of his mother-in-law -- also in Siberia -- hid the radioactive substance in the basement. This did not work. Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer, 45, was also supplied with radioactive material. After 6 December, the Greens politician received a nuclear pill made of uranium 235 in a letter. The anonymous letter accompanying it said: \"Mr. Fischer, check the Hanau nuclear companies.... Be careful, radioactive.\" Since in CIS trade everything can be had that was kept under lock and key by the state in the past, a wave of radioactive material is coming to the West, at \"extremely excessive prices,\" the BND says. Germany is the turntable of the new nuclear smuggling. \"Germany's economic prosperity,\" Peter Kroemer of the BKA says, \"has a particular power of attraction.\" In 1990 the BKA registered four offenses of this kind, in 1991 there were already 41, in 1992 they numbered 158, and last year there were about 200 cases. During a visit to neighboring Poland, which often serves the dealers as a transit and storage site, Kroemer told the Senate Human Rights Committee about the most popular products on Germany's merchant scene. The list ranged from plutonium to uranium 235, cesium 137, and cobalt 60 to strontium 90. The radioactive substances, in particular strontium and cesium, are considered to be dangerous because they cause cancer. The sellers boast that they can lay their hands on any material. Smuggling is booming. How hotly the market is contested is shown by 108 incidents all over the world, which the BND has put together in \"event lists\" for the past two years. Armed, uniformed men stole radioactive material from the Geophysics Institute in Tbilisi, Georgia. During a routine check in Murmansk, Russia, last November, it was noticed that nuclear fuel had been stolen from a storage facility for nuclear submarines. A total of 200 kg of uranium disappeared from a nuclear power plant in Lithuania. Even in Vietnam, 3 kg of plutonium were allegedly offered for sale. A network of dubious nuclear-trading companies is developing. The investigators are often helpless, because legal and illegal practices are inseparably interlaced in these deals. Ice-cold defaulters, bulls, and speculators are hunting for rare and allegedly highly profitable metals, such as scandium or osmium 187 from the former East Bloc states. All of them are mysterious substances. Not even experts know what scandium is supposed to be used for. Osmium 187 is to be used not only for refining the surface of fountain pens, but also as a hard-metal material. No matter what, prices are high. About $70 million is charged for 1 kg of osmium 187, scandium can already be had at $50,000 per kilo. For a long time, the experts of BKA and BND have wondered about the actual point of the strange deals. Finally, they arrived at the most obvious conclusion: greed and simple fraud. In some cases they also think that the motive is money laundering -- pretended deals are a popular method of legalizing illegal money. German and Russian security authorities have been watching this strange poker game for three years. Following the principle of a chain letter, new clients are sought out and there is no lack of participants right from the beginning. \"The criminal energy is great, the circle of participants is becoming increasingly confusing,\" says Vadim Raistein, 37, head of the foreign trade department of an analysis center in Moscow, which is located next door to the Nuclear Energy Ministry. According to Raistein, the institute has had \"a lot of bad experiences with German dealers,\" who send \"the strangest offers.\" The senders are renowned lawyers in Munich, Hamburg, or Duesseldorf. Seized exhibits of nuclear fraud are accumulating in the cupboards of the institute. Says Raistein: \"Sometimes the material is really radioactive, but virtually always it is completely worthless.\" A total of 99 percent of the examined offers are \"pure nonsense.\" Everybody cheats everybody else. Raistein knows several directors of formerly state institutes and nuclear factories, who sign delivery contracts for nonexistent goods and draw up forged expert reports: \"They are tempted by the big money.\" Even government members have signed papers for export without checking them. Raistein: \"They are happy about every single company that is able to fend for itself.\" Western service can often only speculate who is behind the trade in the radioactive materials. Of the roughly 300 suspects who have attracted attention in Germany, about half come from East European countries -- mainly Polish and Russian. According to the findings of the BND, the centers of the illegal nuclear activities are Vilnius and Kaunas in Lithuania. The German accomplices mostly turn out to be rather sinister multitalents. Most of them have attracted attention by fraud or illegal arms deals in the past. Some of them worked for the now-bankrupt Listen-and-Look company, that is, the East Berlin Ministry of State Security. The dead merchants in Lake Constance were obviously small fry. Rimmele and Eichler were two figures in a milieu in which the use of a charter plane also helps to compensate for a bad reputation. In the small Noribau company in Berlin they dealt with real estate, but they always dreamed of the big coup. Contact with a former colonel of the People's Police was supposed to provide the initial impetus. Klaus-Peter Nedwig, 48, son of Lieutenant General Helmut Nedwig, former head of the GDR [German Democratic Republic] criminal police, was Rimmele's great hope. Last autumn, Nedwig, who failed as an insurance agent in the past, telephoned old colleagues from the criminal police and told them to come to Edisonstrasse 63 in Berlin. One of the participants remembers that Rimmele was the one who did the talking there. One could \"make a lot of money\" with rare metals, but the business had to be \"done on a large scale.\" Rimmele announced that he would bring rare metals and other substances to the bonded warehouse of Zurich Kloten Airport by private plane. Now one has to work big, Rimmel said; double-digit million sums were allegedly involved. However, the nuclear chandlers probably had the wrong sense of scale. Until the alleged big coup they had mostly dealt with small amounts and usually lost: Here a few business contacts with merchants from China, there a deceptive hope for a cesium deal in the Baltic states. That involved only the harmless cesium 133 isotope, which does not emit radiation. Their partner in Switzerland was also such a loser. Juerg Jacomet, arms dealer and former informer of the Swiss Military Intelligence Service, used to meet ex-agents of the KGB or the Stasi in the Poestli restaurant in Rumlang near Zurich and dreamed of golden times. At the moment he is reportedly involved in arms deals in Zagreb -- fleeing from the Swiss federal police. Eichler, who was a limited partner of Noribau, is remembered by Uwe Kranz, head of the Thuringian Land Office of Criminal Investigations, as a \"negligible figure.\" In a hotel in Erfurt he once wanted to conclude an osmium deal with some boisterous Hungarian fellows, but that did not work out. The BKA took over the case. Berlin merchants Rimmele and Eichler spent their last day as they spent their lives -- boasting and unsuccessful. Before they were permitted to charter the Cessna, Martin Ewers, 29, manager of the \"Aerowest Braunschweig\" company, demanded that Rimmele pay about DM30,000, which had to be paid right at Prague Airport. Rimmele paid by Eurocard. The final destination was a Paris laboratory with measuring instruments for rare substances. During a stopover at Altenrhein Airport, 5 km from the site of the accident, a client was waiting, who was interested in the miraculous Red Mercury. When the plane did not come, the client, a man from Vaduz, Liechtenstein, quickly disappeared. Better safe than sorry."

            "text": "Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] New York (DPA) -- Germany advocates a \"political solution\" in the Bosnian conflict, but at the same time it has welcomed the NATO decision. It cannot be \"considered as retaliation or as the desire for military action.\" It is part of a political process for a solution by negotiation. This was stated by German UN Ambassador Detlev Count Rantzau on Monday [14 February] at the emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Bosnia in New York. If the unauthorized weapons systems have not been withdrawn within 10 days, the use of force is \"unavoidable\" in reestablishing peace. NATO has threatened to carry out air strikes on the Serbian heavy weapons around Sarajevo if they are not withdrawn or put under UN supervision by 21 February. The German UN ambassador referred to the latest massacre of innocent civilians in Sarajevo. \"These crimes must stop,\" Rantzau demanded. Germany has made every effort to alleviate the suffering of the victims. Almost 400,000 refugees have found refuge in Germany, which is twice as many as in all other European countries together. According to Rantzau, German humanitarian aid amounts to 612 million marks. It is unacceptable that the relief convoys are constantly hindered and helpers are threatened and attacked. According to the UN ambassador, the Federal Government advocates a territorial solution, which ensures the physical and political survival of the Muslims as a nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This implies, above all, a \"satisfactory territorial solution,\" including access to the Sava river and to the sea. The town of Mostar should be put under the administration of the European Union. The German Government has offered to provide an administrator for Mostar. The UN ambassador noted that Bonn supports further close cooperation between the United Nations and the European Union. The German government also welcomes an \"active, strong role\" by the United States. Russian support of the peace efforts will be of great importance. The peace negotiations in Geneva will be continued. They cannot be successful without the political will of the three parties to the conflict. One cannot find a political solution against their will. Germany will provide as much support as possible toward the efforts for peace and stability, the ambassador added."

            "text": "Language: Italian Article Type:BFN [Article by Umberto Torelli: \"A Robot is even Working in the Greenhouse\"] [Text] We are used to robot butlers, and to robots that do dangerous jobs underground, as well as those inside stores where explosives are kept. A robotic manipulator that is just as able to perform operations as the surgeon and uses remote control techniques has also been experimented. This time robotics is being applied to agriculture. The robot \"farmer\" project started at the Agrobot consortium, a pool of university centers and companies working in the sector engaged in the CNR [Italian National Research Council] finalized robotics project. The body of the system, which is designed to work in the greenhouse for the time being, is made up of a strong caterpillar vehicle that can move about, and also serve as a bed on which the produce that has been harvested can be carried. An anthromorphic arm, which can translate and rotate operating with six grades of restraint between ground level and 1.5 meters above ground level, is fixed onto the upper base. The manipulation system is made up of three fingers and lies at the end of the arm. It is entrusted with the job of delicately grasping the produce that is to be picked and this is not simple. The articulated phalanges of each finger are able to assess the consistency of the object being handled with extreme precision, just like the human hand, and evaluate the force that should be applied to take hold of it. Finally there is the vision system. It is as sophisticated as ever and uses a pair of stereo color television cameras. These artificial eyes are given the delicate task of evaluating the size of the obstacles that are met and this information is used to give the correct navigational instructions. But this is not all. The robot can pinpoint the position of the fruits or vegetables with millimetric precision and evaluate the tonalities of their color. In this way it manages to identify flowers for hormone treatment, select the position of fruits to be treated, and above all select the harvest with precision on the basis of the grade of color and the consistency of the pulp. Naturally, it is easy to program the robot so that it picks the fruit that has the weight and form required, then places it in boxes, in rows, with the stalks facing in the same direction. \"At present greenhouse produce is harvested all at once, often picking produce in different stages of maturation,\" says Giulio Sandini of the University of Genoa DIST (Department of Information Science). \"With the advent of robotics all the produce is separately picked, assuring the correct grade of maturity. We must also consider the reduction made in the quantity of chemicals used. Now, when parasites are present, it is necessary to spray the whole area, in the future the robot system will be able to locate the individual plants that are affected and treat them separately.\""
