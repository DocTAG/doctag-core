FBIS3-10551	{"document_id": "FBIS3-10551","text": "eliable Foreign Ministry sources told CLARIN yesterday that, during May, Argentina and Great Britain will resume negotiations on the possibility of some form of cooperation for oil exploration and exploitation in the Malvinas Island coastal waters. The Kelpers are scheduled to begin the process at the end of the year, with or without Argentina's approval.   The date for reopening the negotiations (which have been frozen since 1992) was agreed between Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd during a meeting in London on 3 March. Negotiations will be carried out within the so-called Argentine-British High-Level Group which has been inactive since negotiations failed in 1992.   Di Tella was scheduled to make a private visit to London this coming weekend, but he brought the date forward to 10 March despite the fact that President Carlos Menem was still in Spain. His haste to meet with Hurd was reportedly due to the fact that the meeting was going to take place before this month, but he still did not have British approval, which was only granted on 3 March.   Di Tella and Hurd also agreed to negotiate through diplomatic channels during the time remaining before the meeting -- which must be carried out in Buenos Aires -- in order to formulate a basis for a prior agreement to guarantee some positive results at the key meeting.   One of the hurdles -- beside the conflict over sovereignty that is being kept under the framework of the so-called protective umbrella -- is to define the reaches of the term cooperation.   -- So far, although it is not a definitive answer, Great Britain understands that the term only supposes the exchange of information and the willingness to act jointly to protect the environment.   -- Argentina, however, thinks that the term supposes participation in oil exploration and exploitation within the area controlled by the British.   During the London meeting Di Tella mentioned a topic that is indirectly related to the Malvinas Islands. He mentioned to Hurd Argentina's concern over Great Britain's increasing political and military relations with Chile.   The Argentine foreign minister mentioned the one-week visit future Chilean Defense Minister Perez Yoma is scheduled to make to London and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Chile, among other things.   Hurd's answer was that Perez Yoma was invited before he was named minister and that Thatcher is no longer a member of the British Government.   Hurd affirmed that London does not want to drive any wedge between Argentina and Chile; on the contrary, it is interested in good relations between the two Latin American countries.   The Chilean question was only a side issue of the meeting's central topic: Oil. Di Tella knows that the issue will be essential for the success or failure of his Malvinas policy.   The Kelpers are ready to call for bids on the licenses to begin exploring and exploiting for oil by the end of the year, if negotiations in May fail.   This is why leading Foreign Ministry officials are thinking of discussing the issue with U.S. Vice President Al Gore when he visits Buenos Aires at the end of the month, as CLARIN announced on 2 March.   What diplomats seem not to have been taken into account is that Gore supports ecologist concepts which oppose all off-shore drilling, due to their negative effects on the environment. In any case, to play the North American game now seems premature, unless you believe that the May negotiation will not succeed due to the distance separating the two parties. "}	english	default	1
FBIS3-10646	{"document_id": "FBIS3-10646","text": "Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella told LA NACION on 4 March that after his meeting with Foreign Office head Douglas Hurd in London on 3 March, he is absolutely convinced that Great Britain sees Argentine-Chilean relations with good eyes.   In a telephone call from the United Kingdom, the minister analyzed the meeting and commented on an article about it, which was published on 4 March. Di Tella said the British Government supports rapprochement between the two countries. He added that if relations with Chile were good during President Aylwin's administration they will be very good during the Frei administration, and will have still more impetus.   It is hard to understand Di Tella's ideas, particularly the emphasis given to British support of ties between Argentina and Chile, if facts kept in absolute secrecy until 4 March are ignored. These facts caused surprise and uneasiness among official circles.   The reason behind it was a donation.   Argentina had to conduct diplomatic actions to clarify a British donation to the Chilean Air Museum.   The donation consists of a Harrier plane that still shows where it was hit by Argentine bullets. The plane participated in the Malvinas War. The donation will be officially made on 22 March, presided over by former iron lady Margaret Thatcher, who will visit Santiago from 20 to 23 March.   Some Argentine representatives of the media believe there is the clear intention of affecting the good relations being enjoyed by the two countries, seeking to revert to the times when the theory of balanced forces -- sponsored by the large producing centers -- was fervently complied with in Latin America.   As LA NACION reported, Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella traveled to Chile practically the same day Di Tella left for London. Chilean civilian officials who will soon be installed allegedly knew nothing about the issue.   Although Hurd's answer about the donation has not been made public, the Argentine foreign minister said he had received full explanations about the discussed issues.   In Di Tella's opinion, following the almost 80-minute private meeting with his British counterpart on 3 March, the objective of Thatcher's presence in Santiago are merely to sell her book and give a paid lecture.   Di Tella pragmatically said: The possibility of receiving a few dollars for a book should not be disdained.   Di Tella said Hurd's upcoming visit to the Malvinas Islands has only a relative political importance.   The minister said his British counterpart mentioned to him that he has not visited the islands during the five years he has been in the government.   His visit, however, could be interpreted as a sort of political homage to the islanders, perhaps under pressure from the Conservative Party's hard wing. He will be in Malvinas the day marking the 12th anniversary of the arrival of Argentine forces on the islands on 2 April 1982.   During the telephone conversation, Di Tella gave the impression that Hurd could explain to the islanders the securities offered that Great Britain is clearly seeking ways to cooperate over oil exploration...if that is possible.

FBIS3-19947	{"document_id": "FBIS3-19947","text": "Paris, March 24 (AFP) -- Britain and Argentina clashed over the disputed Falkland Islands in a parliamentary forum here Thursday [24 March], with the Argentinian Senate leader calling on Britain to resume negotiations on sovereignty.   This claim aims at putting an end to the anachronistic colonial situation upheld by Great Britain on a portion of Argentinian territory, in an open violation of the fundamental principles of international law, Eduardo Menem told the Interparliamentary Union [IPU].   The unilateral decisions made by the United Kingdom as regards oil in the Malvinas Islands (the Argentinian name for the disputed islands) and the extension of its alleged jurisdiction around South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, prove the British lack of disposition to start effective negotiations with Argentina, said Menem, brother of Argentinian President Carlos Menem.   But Lord David Montgomery criticised Menem for raising the issue, saying bilateral mechanisms are already in place to continue discussions on all subjects. Mr Menem's statement seems to ignore the rights of the Falkland Islanders in the matter of self-determination, he added.   The two countries fought a brief war over the islands in 1992.

FBIS3-11107	{"document_id": "FBIS3-11107","text": "Seven words uttered by British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd produced a smile on the face of his Argentine counterpart, Guido Di Tella. Hurd said: We could possibly agree on broad cooperation on the oil exploration the Kelpers want to initiate by the end of the year in the waters surrounding the Malvinas Islands. British sources told CLARIN on 12 March that Hurd made this remark to Di Tella during a meeting last week in London.   As CLARIN already announced, this definition will be the new basis for the position the British will champion late this month or in early April when negotiations attempting to achieve some form of cooperation on the oil issue will be resumed. Negotiations have been suspended since late 1992, when the United Kingdom unilaterally decided to initiate seismic prospecting work in the sea bed surrounding the Malvinas Islands despite Argentine protests.   Initially, Hurd talked about cooperation alone, which ideally represented exchanging information. British sources announced that, in diplomatic parlance, however, this new definition means that London is willing to accept the participation of Argentine companies in the exploration effort and the replenishment and repair of oil platforms in Argentine ports. A similar message was conveyed by the British ambassador in Buenos Aires, Peter Hall, to Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella during a meeting they held on 7 March to discuss the crisis in Yugoslavia.   Nevertheless, this is not the final British position. Hurd will travel on 9 April to the Malvinas Islands for consultations with the islanders -- who refuse to restore communications with Argentina -- before initiating negotiations with Buenos Aires. The Malvinas Islands' residents only are willing to cooperate with Argentina if necessary and are moving ahead -- full steam -- with their preparations: They already have received a Royal Geological Service report recommending where to drill in order to determine the existence of oil and establishing the required legal or tax framework.   Incidentally, this is one of the most difficult points for negotiations that demonstrates that both oil and fishing are closely linked to the sovereignty conflict. Argentina wants to collect part of the taxes that will be charged to the oil companies, but the United Kingdom rejects this possibility, even though it is not yet known with complete certainty if there is oil.   Florencio Acenolaza, the Chamber of Deputies Foreign Relations Committee chairman and a geologist by profession, recently noted in a communique that there is no oil in the Malvinas Islands' submarine shelf.   YPF [Government Oil Deposits] President Jose Estenssoro quickly went to the Foreign Ministry to make it clear that Acenolaza based himself on outdated information and that YPF is studying one of the two seismic surveys carried out in the Malvinas Islands last year. Official sources confirmed to CLARIN that the survey was purchased through a YPF subsidiary. The report is confidential because it is a commercial secret.   Nevertheless, the existence of hydrocarbons will not be proven until the sea bed is drilled, despite the positive seismic reports. The basins may be empty, with more gas than oil or with little oil, which would make the business unprofitable. "}	english	default	1
FBIS3-10697	{"document_id": "FBIS3-10697","text": "London -- Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella's innocent three-day trip to England to visit his son Rafael has yielded other results. He discovered that John Major's administration considers the issue of negotiations with the Menem administration on the issue of oil around the Malvinas Island convenient but not indispensable and that the United Kingdom is ready to lift the arms embargo imposed on Argentina since the Malvinas war.   CLARIN talked with Di Tella, who was staying at the Argentine Embassy residence in Paris and will arrive back in Buenos Aires this morning.   [CLARIN] What are the results of your meeting with Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Secretary Douglas Hurd?   [Di Tella] I had a long meeting with him and ended up clarifying two important issues: negotiations on oil exploration, which will have a busy agenda, and the issue of relations with Chile. It was established that we will cooperate. They consider British-Argentine negotiations convenient but not indispensable, and we consider them indispensable. The two countries have agreed that it is convenient.   [CLARIN] Has Hurd offered you seismic prospecting results or told you how much oil there is in the islands?   [Di Tella] They have not been very explicit and they have not given me any seismic prospecting work. They assured us that they are still not sure how much oil there is in the area.   [CLARIN] Did he reproach you for Argentina's theft of the seismic prospecting carried out on orders of the island's government through an Argentine ghost company?   [Di Tella] They did not complain. On the other hand, it was not a ghost company but a YPF [Government Oil Deposits] subsidiary. I cannot recall the name of the company now.   [CLARIN] Did you establish an agenda to discuss the oil situation?   [Di Tella] There is a verbal agreement. But never before was the convenience of negotiating the issue of oil exploration mentioned so explicitly. A technical team will meet in April to discuss these questions.   [CLARIN] Great Britain's problem is that insurance companies refuse to insure off shore [preceding two words in English] explorations in conflict zones such as the area around the Malvinas Islands. In the back of their minds they have the ghost of what happened with Kuwait's oil wells, which were set on fire by the Iraqis. How will Argentina take advantage of this situation in negotiations for the Malvinas Islands?   [Di Tella] Argentina can create serious juridical problems for Great Britain in the South Atlantic. We are going to do just that. The British Government is at a point where it must discuss the issue of oil exploration with us. Our warning notes on the matter have worried companies in the area.   [CLARIN] Are you using that as a future threat?   [Di Tella] It is not a threat. That is life...If you push a door bell you will hear a noise...I will take every legal step possible to achieve our objective.   [CLARIN] Did you discuss the Argentine Government's apprehensions about British interference in Argentine-Chilean relations?   [Di Tella] That was one of the main reasons for my trip and my interest in seeing Hurd. It was one of the topics on our agenda. I talked to him about the excellent status of Argentine-Chilean relations and the need we have for Great Britain to help consolidate it.   [CLARIN] What did Hurd say about Margaret Thatcher's visit to Chile in the next few days?   [Di Tella] Hurd told me that Mrs. Thatcher is going to Chile because she feels like it. Maggie has never (in English), and least of all now, accepted pressure from anyone. She is promoting her Memories and has made more than 3 million pounds from it. For her the monetary issue is very important. She cannot be pressured, least of all by John Major's government.   [CLARIN] Why will Hurd travel to Malvinas if British-Argentine relations are so good?   [Di Tella] Hurd simply told me: I have been in the post for five years and never visited the islands. Besides you are very active diplomatically and you visit us every three months. I am highly encouraged to see that my charming [preceding word in English] operation is yielding these results.   [CLARIN] According to British sources, the Major government is ready to sell arms to Argentina.   [Di Tella] They can offer them. We do not have any problems. We want an end to the arms embargo. In this visit to London I had the impression that the arms embargo issue will soon be a thing of the past. "}	english	default	1

The Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs today released the documents produced by the last regional seminar on this subject, which was held in Santiago last September.   The report stresses that each country must establish a national authority that will prohibit in their respective territories or in any place under their control the existence of chemical weapons, trade in elements for their manufacturing, or research to develop this kind of war materiel.   The documents point out that countries like Argentina, Cuba, Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela are concerned with preventing impediments to economic and technological development in the area, and with establishing solid bases for trade in chemical substances not suitable for war use.

This courtesy will be returned in Buenos Aires today, when David Spedding -- the number two man in the British MI6 service, and the future number one by the end of 1994 -- will arrive here for a three-day stay.   As a result of this meeting it was decided that SIDE [Secretariat for State Intelligence] agents will be trained in intelligence analysis by British spies in the next few months.   During a rainy morning yesterday, and watched over by discreet bodyguards, Anzorreguy held a long conversation in impeccable English with Colin McColl, chief of the domestic espionage service MI5 [title as received].   More feminine, Stella Rimmington -- the first woman directing the foreign secret service MI6 [title as received] -- invited him on the same day to lunch at San Lorenzo restaurant, Lady Di's favorite restaurant in Knightsbridge, near Harrods. Rimmington extended the invitation to Anzorreguy's wife, Margarita Moline O'Connor, who accompanied her husband on this tour of espionage and good manners through Spain, France, and London.   Anzorreguy's visit had previously been canceled due to the illness of President Carlos Menem.   With British coolness, Colin McColl told Anzorreguy -- five minutes after beginning the conversation -- that the British intelligence services are very discreet: They do not grant interviews, or allow photographs, or let any information be leaked. In subliminal language he meant to say that the conversation should be kept strictly off the record.   Anzorreguy was appalled with the MI5 chief's knowledge of the Argentine dirty war; he knew so much that it was as if he had absorbed the minds of an Argentine military officer and a guerrilla member.   The subject of terrorism monopolized the conversation, together with the problem of immigration as a possible source of conflict.   For McColl, the problems are the Pakistanis, Indians, and residents of the former British colonies in the Caribbean. Anzorreguy told him that their equivalent, for Argentina, are the Paraguayans, Bolivians, Chileans, and Peruvians who want to come to Argentina dazed by the economic miracle.   When a year ago Anzorreguy visited the chief of the Russian secret services in Moscow, the Russian chief's first question was very direct. Tell me what Galtieri was like, the Soviet spy asked with curiosity, in referring to the Argentine general who commanded the Malvinas War. Anzorreguy swallowed his feelings, remembered the description of majestic general used by an aide to (former U.S. President) Reagan to describe the mastermind of the invasion of the islands, and answered: He was a presumptuous general.   Stella Rimmington did not ask a single question about the Malvinas War, and much less about Galtieri's personality or about the investigations into the soldiers executed in the Malvinas Islands. In her new and austere office with a view of the River Thames, the MI6 chief aimed the conversation toward the danger of nuclear proliferation without control and terrorism.   Rimmington walks daily from her house to her office without any guards; she has been photographed only once; she has no domestic servant; and she is an expert Sovietologist.   During their conversation Anzorreguy stressed the excellent diplomatic relations between Argentina and Chile.   When CLARIN asked Anzorreguy about the misunderstandings between Chile and Argentina that Argentine Foreign Ministry sources attributed to the British Government, Mr. Five [senor cinco] minimized these: These are pranks that we could play, too, he said.

FBIS3-10889	{"document_id": "FBIS3-10889","text": "U.S. Vice President Al Gore will arrived in Brasilia on 21 March. He will invite President Itamar Franco to the hemispheric summit that will meet in the next few months.   Gore's agenda also includes a debate with political leaders, entrepreneurs, and environmentalists, possibly with radio and television coverage.   It is one form of doing politics based on the tradition of British colonizers who promoted debates with communities before making decisions.   The Clinton administration has started doing that, domestically. Gore wants to do it in Brasilia.   The issue will be a single one during his meeting with Itamar Franco, during the summit meeting or during the public debate: the Americas' integration.   The issue has become vital to the United States' future leadership, in the Clinton government's view.   Jeffrey Garten, former banker and Wall Street broker and current U.S. commerce under secretary for international trade, summarized it this way: Our future capacity to compete, create jobs, and remain world leaders will depend on our capacity to succeed in the larger emerging markets.   For Washington there are three large emerging markets in Latin America: Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.   The candidates to succeed President Itamar Franco should begin pondering this new U.S. diplomatic offensive in Latin America that started with the signing of the free trade agreement with Mexico.   It is crucial for any political power project in the region. It is the main condition for any government such as the Brazilian Government, which is betting on an autonomous foreign policy based on the full dominion of the Amazon basin (in the north) and the River Plate basin (in the south).   The Gore mission is an act that intends to prepare the Latin American political arena for the application of the new foreign relations model that Washington developed with Mexico and Canada during NAFTA's negotiations.   Gore's agenda during his 48 hours in Latin America is eloquent: Before coming to Brasilia he will travel to Buenos Aires. In Buenos Aires he is scheduled to give a strong speech at the World Telecommunications Conference -- the most coveted business circle in the world.   He will speak about reinventing governments through a reduction of the state role in the economy. He should not repeat the same speech in Brazil. The State Department is afraid of hurting the feelings of nationalists who might possibly identify Gore's words with an interference in domestic affairs at a moment Congress is trying to revise the Constitution.   In Buenos Aires, the U.S. vice president must confirm the possibility of closing with Argentina, possibly this year, the first protocols on free trade.   That strategy with Argentina, as the U.S. bureaucracy defines it, will represent progress in the direction of a common commercial promotion project (environmental technology and spare parts); the sale of capital goods, telecommunications equipment, transportation, and basic sanitation with assured financing; assistance in the financial sector's deregulation; and technological cooperation in urban and environmental engineering and biotechnology.   It is a package in NAFTA's direction with the White House's stamp on it and the parallel support of multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.   Franco's successor will be installed on 1 January 1995. That day, the borders of the Common Market of the South [Mercosur] will open up.   Mercosur, as well as NAFTA, are already part of the scenery. Both projects have problems, but they might represent converging solutions.   It will depend exclusively on the capacity of rulers to use these projects as political instruments for introducing changes in this absurd picture of income distribution that is threatening the future of democracy in Latin America.   The alternative is a political confrontation. "}	english	default	1

One of the short-term objectives of the EC is the construction of an experimental reactor as part of global cooperation. It will be based on the magnetic confinement of deuterium and tritium plasma, followed by the design and construction of a demonstration reactor.   The experimental fusion reactor, named ITER [International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor], is to be built around the year 2000 and already involves major research efforts into materials, subjected to the extreme service conditions which cause their deterioration.   The international conference in Stresa, attended by 400 scientists from 23 countries (for the first time there was a major delegation from Russia), examined the mechanisms of degradation and the remedies for expanding the working potential of materials for fusion reactors.   More specifically materials can be developed which, though becoming partially radioactive due to the neutrons generated by the fusion process, will be able to lose their radioactivity gradually within 20-30 years. By using this type of material the energy generated by the fusion process may become clean. "}	english	default	1
FBIS3-43040	{"document_id": "FBIS3-43040","text": "Engineering Academy, B.Ye. Karasev, doctor of technical sciences and academician, International Information Academy, A.V. Logunov, corresponding member, International Engineering Academy, and V.D. Matyushin, candidate of technical sciences, NIID [expansion not given]; boldface as published in source text; UDC 502.7]   [Text] Under the conditions of continuous intensification of production, the problem of environmental protection and rational use of natural resources is becoming increasingly socially and economically significant. Included among the matters classified under this problem are the following: pollution of the water and air by toxic industrial wastes, toxic chemicals, and radioactive materials; prevention of harmful consequences of the use of pesticides to fight pests and diseases in agriculture and forestry; soil erosion and recultivation; further development of the legal bases of environmental protection; and economic assessment of natural resources.   The development of production, scientific and engineering progress, and expansion of human industrial activity must not destroy the harmony that has been established in nature or destroy natural resources. There are no wastes in nature: All biological, chemical, and physical processes occur in a closed circle.   All industrial enterprises affect the environment to some degree or other. Research has shown that at least one third of all processible raw material is now transformed into finished products. Consequently, the remaining fraction of raw materials becomes wastes that are often harmful to the environment. In the past decade, the volume of industrial wastes released into the atmosphere in conjunction with the rapid increase in industrial development has increased sharply and continues to increase. Each year, industrial enterprises, thermal electric power plants, motor vehicles, blast furnaces, aircraft engines, and other machines release hundreds of millions of tons of carbon in the form of oxides, primarily carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.   The carbon dioxide released by humans and the animal world is absorbed by plant life to provide a stable state of equilibrium in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, this equilibrium has now been upset, and the alarm of ecological catastrophe is sounding louder with each passing year. The continuing increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an especially negative phenomenon. Carbon dioxide is known to be toxic in large quantities: It causes hypoxia and debilitated respiration and cardiac activity. An increase in carbon dioxide concentration not only has a direct effect on organisms but also facilitates an increase in absorption of the earth's thermal radiation by the atmosphere, which in turn results in climate warming throughout the entire planet. As is known, in the past 100 years, the average temperature of the earth's surface increased by 0.5-0.6ë, which has in turn accelerated glacial thawing and increased the sea's level by 1.5-2 m.   Also released along with carbon dioxide during the combustion process is carbon monoxide, which has an even more toxic effect and which may result in debilitation of many vital functions, including illness of the central nervous system.   Metallurgy plants and thermal power plants release a large amount of sulfur dioxide. Fossil fuels also contain a great deal of sulfur. Each year, about 30 million tons of sulfurous gas are released in our country. When sulfur dioxide reacts with atmospheric moisture, sulfurous and sulfuric acids form. When nitrogen-containing coal and oil are burned, oxides are formed that combine with atmospheric moisture to yield nitrous and nitric acids. These acids may cause serious lung diseases.   Ecological and sanitary and hygiene estimates are formulated on the basis of data about emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere.   In nature, everything is interconnected. Toxic impurities that end up in the air are returned to the earth in the form of precipitation falling on pastures, meadows, fields, gardens, and vegetable gardens. Polluted precipitation also falls into water reservoirs. The acids contained in precipitation react with metals (aluminum, cadmium, mercury, lead, etc.) in the soil, and they infect the water and thus the fish.   Precipitation is not the only source of water pollution. Industrial, transport, and household wastes are dumped into water reservoirs in quantities such that many rivers and lakes can no longer be cleaned with existing resources. The natural purity of relatively shallow ground waters has been lost. Phosphates from wastes, the nitrates that are used everywhere as fertilizers, and other toxic materials have infiltrated them. The situation regarding irrigation water is no better. Its chemical composition largely dictates the quality of agricultural projects, in which the content of nitrates, phosphates, and metals has also risen. Countries with a high technological discipline permit the use of relatively small amounts of fertilizer. In countries with a lower technological discipline, the level is higher owing to an attempt to increase crop yields. As a rule, this results in a decline in product quality.   And so, the circle has closed: People harm the environment, the environment shortens their life. The child mortality rate in many countries has stopped decreasing, and in several countries it has even begun to increase. Studies conducted by the World Health Organization gave the sad results: An elevated lead content was discovered in the blood of 30 percent of neonates. Where is the way out?   Reason suggests that, as soon as possible, further destruction of nature must be halted, it must be restored on a planetwide scale, and population control must be begun so as not to extend beyond the scope of the biosphere's objective capabilities. Understanding of the fact that people's lives truly depend on their effect on nature has not yet become widespread.   It must be acknowledged that more than a few measures to regulate man's relationship with nature have been developed. In the developed countries, where the economy is subject to market relationships, energy-saving technologies are being developed intensively. This is making it possible to burn less fuel and, consequently, reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere. The manufacture of lead-free gasoline has begun, and exhaust gases have begun to contain far less toxic impurities.   Today, the search for ways of solving ecological problems is being conducted at the international, state, and sector levels. Many countries regularly exchange information about the current condition of the environment and are creating a common ecological data bank.   Unfortunately, our country has not yet become sufficiently actively engaged in this process. And the situation in our country cannot be called good. According to existing data, about 30 million of our citizens are living in ecological disaster areas. Life itself is compelling us to consider the problems of restoring and protecting nature as priority problems.   Quality sewage treatment is not provided in 600 cities, more than two thirds of toxic sources do not meet the requirements specified in standards. Volumes of unutilizable toxic industrial wastes are increasing, and a large portion of them are transported to household waste dumps or else to disorganized storage sites, which eventually results in toxic materials ending up in underground waters and water reservoirs and in infection of the plant and animal world.   Unfortunately, the aviation industry, whose technical policy has long failed to recognize ecology as a priority directly, is a definite contributor to these negative consequences of economic activity.   Each year, about 290,000 tons of toxic materials in the form of gases released from stationary sources are formed throughout the sector as a whole. From them, dust- and gas-scrubbing units trap 136,500 tons of toxic materials (47.1 percent), and 153,700 tonnes, i.e., about 0.25 percent of the total volume of wastes throughout the country, are released into the atmosphere. Considering the fact that the sector's enterprises are located in cities with an industrially developed potential, where tough standards are in effect, and also, as a rule, in densely populated complexes of apartment buildings, the negative effect of the sector's production on the environment is not always adequately reflected by the volumes of emissions of toxic materials. In the total mass of emissions, the greatest volume percentage of pollutants comes from boiler and other thermal power plants (36-40 percent), foundry work (15-18 percent), painting (14-15 percent), and engine ground tests (14-15 percent). The sector's production is characterized by a long list of wastes. And although solid particles and hydrocarbons predominate in the composition of toxic materials generated (they account for 74.6 and 13 percent respectively), individual enterprises release up to 70 different toxic elements and compounds into the air medium.   Each year, about 3,800,000 tons of ash, slag, spend molding and core mixtures, sediments in cleaning equipment, and other wastes are generated at the sector's enterprises. Of that amount, 800,000 tons is toxic. Hundreds of thousands of tons of abrasive dust containing cobalt, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, chromium, nickel, vanadium, and other metals that are needed for industry but are nevertheless harmful to the environment are released each year.   According to data from a 1992 inventory of sector enterprises throughout Moscow, the total volume of toxic wastes generated consists of the following: 33 percent are wastes of galvanic and other types of chemical treatment; 17 percent are petroleum products (oils, cutting fluids, and storm sewer slimes); 12 percent are wastes containing highly toxic heavy metals (dusts, slags, slimes); 8 percent are spent liquid organic solvents, highly flammable liquids, and vat sediments left after regeneration of solvents; 5 percent are wastes from paint and varnish production; and 21 percent are other toxic wastes.   The problems of ecological improvement of the sector's production and creation of new resource-saving low-waste technologies and equipment have not yet become basic and binding. It should be noted, however, that the sector's institutes are definitely working in this direction.   The development and introduction into the sector of fluxless melting of magnesium alloys and mechanization of their casting by using vacuum furnaces with a gas shield have made it possible to significantly reduce protection of the air medium and reduce the toxicity of wastes (slags). Also noteworthy from the standpoint of protection of the air medium and reduction of the toxicity of production wastes (slags) is the development of a process and equipment for vacuum preparation (degassing) of aluminum alloys instead of the process of refining them in layers. The process has been introduced on a wide scale at aviation industry enterprises and in other sectors.   Work to replace graphite during the shaped casting of titanium alloys by artificial corundum by using titanium powder obtained from titanium wastes as a coating is now under way. This will reduce the use of toxic binders (synthetic resins).   From an ecology standpoint, work to create processes and equipment for progressive automated high-precision methods of casting metals and alloys with complete regeneration, recovery, and neutralization of the wastes generated and to introduce them at sector enterprises should become a priority in foundry work.   In the past few years, the following ecologically promising low-waste processes and equipment for heat-treating components have been introduced by sector enterprises: ion nitriding of components used in basic production; vacuum nitriding of screws and cylinders made of titanium alloys; and heat treating magnesium alloy castings in ecologically pure media (in a vacuum or sulfur hexafluoride gas). This has made it possible to cut emissions of toxic materials by a factor of 2-3.   In the area of machining, the NIID [expansion not given; Defectology Scientific Research Institute (?)] and sector enterprises have jointly developed and introduced the following low-waste processes and equipment:   -- a resource-saving process involving the use of domestic cutting fluids instead of imported ones in the operations of grinding the blanks of components made of difficult-to-machine materials that has simultaneously doubled/tripled the duration of cutting fluid use and permitted effective cleaning of oil residues from the water in spent cutting fluids. The cost savings has been in the vicinity of 850,000 rubles;   -- an ecologically pure process for applying reinforcing coatings on a cutting tool by the vacuum ion-plasma method that has made it possible to boost a tool's wear resistance by a factor of 5 or 6;   -- a process for diamond and artificial diamond grinding of blades that has made it possible to reduce dust by 40 percent;   -- a briquetting process based on the use of plastics (glass-filled polyamide) to automate and mechanize the manufacture of blades at a number of the subsector's enterprises instead of toxic and scarce materials (alloys of the Wood's type);   -- a process for finishing precision components of fuel-regulating equipment by using honing heads instead of finishing treatment with abrasive pastes that has reduced consumption of abrasives and, consequently, their release into the atmosphere by a factor of 3.   In the area of installing and testing on-board systems, the following have been developed:   -- ecologically pure processing for checking leaktightness based on aqueous solutions of surfactants with color indication instead of the oil-and-whiting method;   -- a stand to check the hydraulic characteristics of pneumatic-hydraulic system components by using demineralized water and a stand for comprehensive development of pneumatic-hydraulic systems by using distillate and neural gas (nitrogen) instead of highly toxic working fluids and expensive helium.   In the area of magnetic testing methods, work to introduce television-magnetic inspection of series-produced components was done in 1990-1992. This type of inspection may replace the x-ray and magnetic powder methods for simply shaped components made of magnetic materials and would make it possible to eliminate the use of x-radiation and single-use x-ray films from the inspection operation, as well as eliminate developer and fixative wastes. In the case of the television-magnetic method, there are no wastes, and the magnetic tape may be used multiple times.   Completion of the aforesaid projects will make it possible to reduce the release of toxic materials (finely dispersed dust, nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc.) into the atmosphere, eliminate contamination of the atmosphere and water reservoirs by highly flammable liquids and pollution of the atmosphere by the volatile components of paints and varnishes, improve the sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor, reduce pollution of water sources by petroleum products, etc.   Despite the definite work conducted by the sector with respect to ecological improvement of production and creation of new low-waste processes, it is, as is evident from the above data, still difficult to call this activity purposive and effective.   To a certain extent, significant ecological problems arise during aviation operations. The greenhouse gases CO[.sup]2[/], water vapor, and NO[.sub]x[/] nitric oxides form as kerosene burns in an aircraft engine. Efforts are currently under way to improve combustion chambers to reduce nitrogen oxide wastes.   The only way of significantly reducing or completely eliminating these wastes, however, is to use cryogenic fuel such as liquefied natural gas or liquid hydrogen. The development of cryogenic fuel-based aviation will make it possible to eliminate aviation's dependence on diminishing petroleum reserves.   Development and assimilation of the following processes/equipment are planned as priority directions of ecological improvement over the next few years:   -- ecologically pure processes and equipment to wash components and subassemblies with aqueous solutions of commercial detergents instead of gasoline, kerosene, and other health-damaging materials that will simultaneously make it possible to economize fuel and raw material resources;   -- a process and equipment for applying powder polymer coatings onto gas turbine engine components in an electrostatic field that will make it possible to eliminate paint solvent vapors and aerosols in the atmosphere;   -- systems to evacuate and recover the chloride gas medium used when producing diffusion coatings on gas turbine engine components by the circulation method from the gaseous phase that will result in an ecologically pure technological process;   -- a process and equipment for creating ecologically pure technological media for high-temperature soldering of refractory alloys to reduce the formation of fluoride compounds by a factor of 6-8;   -- a process and automated chambers for microcomputer-controlled high-energy plasma-torch spraying of coatings to reduce the labor required for the soldering process by 25 percent on average.   These efforts will make it possible to accomplish the following: reduce emissions of toxic materials (finely dispersed dust, nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc.) into the atmosphere; eliminate pollution of the atmosphere and water reservoirs; improve the sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor; eliminate pollution of the atmosphere by paint material components; and reduce pollution of water sources by petroleum products.   The development of science-intensive processes and equipment and their introduction into industry are still far from adequate. One of the main distinguishing features of science-intensive technologies and production is the fact that they require little raw material and energy (i.e., they are more resource-saving); therefore, the wastes generated when they are used are not great. Water consumption in these processes is also much lower than in conventional industrial processes, which ultimately reduces the amount of contaminated sewage.   Membrane, ultrasound, laser, plasma, high-speed machining, and progressive casting are among those resource-saving low-waste and science-intensive processes that are especially significant for the sector's production on an ecological plane.   The sector's lack of a systems approach to solving these problems is another very important reason why the work that is being done with respect to ecological improvement of industry and creation of new types of resource-saving low-waste processes has not been effective enough.   According to the standard international classification system, the aviation sector is among the 10 most science-intensive sectors. It is understood that the task of switching the industry over to science-intensive low-waste processes in the present period under the conditions of the systems of economic relationships that have developed in the sector, where the business agreement with enterprises has by and large become the main source of financing R&amp;D, is rather difficult.   One of the main priority tasks related to organizing a systems approach is that of developing a special integrated environmental protection program. The foundation of this program consists of measures geared toward ecological improvement of the sector's existing production and creation of new resource-saving low-waste processes with mandatory expert examination in all stages of development, introduction, and dissemination for the purpose of clarifying their ecological feasibility.   The technological measures planned by the sector should be based on priority directions, including those in the field of ecological improvement of the sector's production as determined first and foremost by the list of enterprises, types of production and processes, and materials with the biggest negative effect on the environment.   The technology section of the sector's integrated ecology program must contain a number of subprograms in different directions of environmental protection activity. Specifically, each subsector must have a separate program of operations to create a process and equipment for regenerating, recovering, and neutralizing production and consumption wastes.   Expert ecological examination must be given a great deal of attention as a tool that makes it possible to make a scientifically well founded decision regarding the need to develop new technologies, as well as the need to replace and further develop ecologically imperfect technological processes, equipment, and materials that are in use.   In addition, it is necessary to have a system that makes it possible to conduct expert evaluations and prevent possible negative ecological and economic consequences of the effect of the sector's production on the environment. What is needed most on this plane is coordination of the efforts of sector institutes in accordance with their specialization as a part of the methodological, standards and related reference information, and technical-organizational support of such an expert evaluation, which should be mandatory for all associations and enterprises. The expert evaluation should be based on a comprehensive study of the effect on the environment in several directions, i.e., the effect on the air in the work zone's atmosphere, water consumption, generation of solid waste, etc.   The sector's institutes now have the materials required to conduct expert evaluations. For example, they now have the following: normative-reference material related to determining indicators for an ecological-economic evaluation of the sector's manufacturing facilities from the standpoint of contamination of all industrial sewage; normative-reference material related to the basic manufacturing processes and allocation of water with consideration for its quality; a method of calculating the quantitative characteristics of emissions of toxic materials into the atmosphere from the basic types of manufacturing equipment at the sector's enterprises; a normative-methodological list of indicators of emissions of materials that pollute the atmosphere and civil aviation motors for use in ecological evaluations and forecasts; and sector methodological guidelines regarding calculating toxic emissions form aircraft engines. The Russian Federation Ministry of Health and other industrial sectors also have a number of methodological materials.   A group of environmental protection specialists at the NIID are conducting a systematic check of completed scientific research work and newly developed and improved technological processes to analyze their effect on the environment and their conformity to the requirements of environmental protection legislation so as to prevent the introduction of technological processes that do not meet the requirements of environmental protection and rational use of natural resources.   The training of engineering personnel both in institutes and in enterprises for the purpose of providing them with the required body of modern ecological knowledge acquires great importance in this respect.   Only when specialists have in-depth knowledge of the interaction of nature and society, the consequences of industrial pollution of the environment, rational methods and ways of using nature, the requirements of environmental protection legislation, ways of protecting the environment against industrial emissions, ways of estimating the damage done to nature, and other matters will they be capable of actively introducing expert ecological examinations into the sector, increasing its quality, and consequently producing a product that is not ecologically harmful.   Purposive and effective work toward ecological improvement of the sector's production based on resource-saving and low-waste technology is impossible without significant improvement of organizational work in this direction.   In this regard, special attention must be paid to developing organizational methodological materials to support the use of recyclable material resources in the national economy.   The problem of increasing the effectiveness and rational use of recyclable material resources is one of the most important problems in the sector's production. Hundreds of thousands of tons of recyclable material resources pile up at the sector's enterprises each year. Table 1 presents the volumes of the generation, use, and destruction of recyclable material resources in the sector in 1991. It is evident from Table 1 that between 4 and 83 percent of recyclable material resources is destroyed depending on the type of resource. The main thrust of the sector's economic strategy is effective use of recyclable material resources in production, the main directions of which are presented in Table 2. "}	english	default	1
FBIS3-42459	{"document_id": "FBIS3-42459","text": "The Mosaeroshow-92 Russian International Aerospace Exhibition took place on 11-16 August 1992 in the Moscow suburb of Zhukovskiy. The Flying-Research Institute (LII) imeni M.M. Gromov, Aviaeksport Association, and the German firm Glahe International organized it. The exhibition received experts and journalists from 11 through 14 August and everyone who wished to attend on 15 and 16 August, and an air show was conducted on 16 August in honor of Air Force Day.   The exhibition took place at an airfield belonging to LII, the main VPP [runway] of which is 5,500 meters long. There are no such large airfields in Europe, and only the airfield at Edwards Air Base in the United States can be compared to it. Russia spent 85 million rubles [R] to organize the air show, of which R60 million was spent on construction of roads and city infrastructure and R25 million on development of the exhibition complex itself. A portion of the expenditures was covered by the cost of entry tickets. With the price of a ticket at R30, the amount of proceeds from entry payments totaled more than R8 million and, considering the lease payments by the exhibitors, we can assume that a large portion of the cost of the exhibition complex was covered.   The Mosaeroshow-92 organizers managed to develop the aerospace exhibition complex in a record short period of time (3.5 months). The exhibition complex hardly lags behind the most famous aircraft exhibition complex in the world at Le Bourget (near Paris).   The opportunity that was offered to domestic aerospace enterprises to show their items at Mosaeroshow-92 completely meets the assigned task to market domestic products. This opportunity is valuable first of all for the producers and developers of aircraft equipment, few of whom are capable of systematically participating in foreign exhibitions.   According to data cited in a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interview with OKB [Experimental Design Bureau] imeni A.I. Mikoyan general designer R.A. Belkov, in 1991 not a single aircraft from their OKB was sold abroad. A dramatic decline in exports was observed in the entire domestic defense industry in 1991. A certain bias on the part of a number of potential foreign purchasers regarding Russian arms as a result of their unsuccessful employment during the course of the Persian Gulf War is among the primary causes of this, as well as the lack of sophistication of domestic sales structures and possible pressure on the Russian Government by the United States. Exhibitions of the Mosaeroshow-92 type will help to disperse the bias arising from inadequately thorough analysis of combat operations and knowledge of Russian equipment. "}	english	default	1
FBIS3-42854	{"document_id": "FBIS3-42854","text": "I have been telling my Western colleagues that had they had a steep price hike like we had in Estonia, they would have had rioting in the streets, says energy minister Arvo Niitenberg smugly, as he recalls the economic crisis of the 70's in the United States. At that time, Americans raised the price of a liter of gasoline by 10 cents, and there were incidents of shooting at gas stations. Estonia's energetics has survived a major price shock over the past two years. Coal, heating oil, natural gas, diesel fuel and gasoline have been brought to world market prices. Oil shale and electricity are not at world market prices, says Niitenberg, satisfied that Estonia has moved into world economy. The price of gasoline in Estonia and the world price of unprocessed crude are now linked.   One dramatic example of relentlessly rising prices is the 754-time jump in the price of natural gas, as compared to the Soviet era. The minister believes that our energy policy which, in its formative stages, drew praise from its teachers like the World Bank, the European Bank of Development and Reconstruction, and other organizations, will make Estonia stronger in the future. The days of wasting cheap energy are over. <H5>  No More Sudden Price Hikes </H5>  As is happening elsewhere, the price of energy in Estonia will still be going up, but I don't foresee any sudden jumps, says Niitenberg and finds that the price of electricity, for example, is favorably low, compared to some of our neighbors. He does not believe that the price of electricity will ever go up to Finland's level (5 times higher than ours), and that Estonia will always have an advantage. Electricity is unnaturally cheap in Russia but, compared to other neighboring states, Estonian producers enjoy a certain advantage.   While the consumption of electricity has been going up lately, the demand for liquid fuel has been dropping. During 1993, only 600,000 tonnes of heating oil were consumed, compared to its previous consumption levels of up to 1,600,000 tonnes a year.   Part of that difference is attributable to user economy, the rest to a general economic decline. I believe we can increase production without drastically increasing the demand for energy. We have to reduce the energy loss that currently amounts to roughly one third of the total. If that part of the energy could be used to develop the economy, energy expenditures would not have to go up for the time being, Niitenberg says. As an example, he cites Denmark, where energy consumption goes up by less than 1 percent, yet the economy is developing at a much faster rate. This is the result of energy conservation programs. The Danes have made a transition to more modern heating systems, they have financing. Estonia, by contrast, is plagued by lack of capital. <H5>  The Proportion of Domestic Fuel Is Small </H5>  For the development of energetics, we have received loans from the European Community totaling 76.7 million Estonian kroons. With that money, more than 140 energy-related projects have been carried out in different parts of Estonia. These have been mostly small plants for local parish use, installed to make a transition to domestic fuel, and to reduce energy loss, Niitenberg says.   The proportion of domestic fuel sources is currently not as great in Estonia as it is in our neighboring countries. Timber and peat provide 3.5 percent of the necessary energy. In the Nordic countries, this share is roughly 7 percent; in Finland between 12 and 13 percent.   It would be possible to increase the share of timber and peat to 10 percent. It is interesting to note that, even though Estonia imports much of its fuel, close to 70 percent of the energy is obtained locally. In this respect we are much better off than Latvia or Lithuania. We have oil shale, electricity, timber and peat, only liquid fuel and natural gas are brought in, Niitenberg says. <H5>  Estonia Needs an Explosives Plant </H5>  Out of the production cost for oil shale, one third goes for explosives which, for the time being, are still coming from our eastern neighbors. Prices of explosives and fuses have gone up and that, in turn, has jacked up the price of oil shale. Eesti PÅolevkivi [Estonian Oil Shale] is in the process of negotiating with a Swedish and a German firm for putting up an explosives plant in Estonia, specifically for mining. Depending on technology, this will require an investment of roughly $5 to $10 million. A study is being conducted to show how fast the plant can pay for itself.   Last year, 13.5 million tonnes of oil shale were produced in Estonia, and I cannot see that volume going down in the near future. We can tell potential foreign buyers that the market is stable, and give them certain guarantees, Niitenberg thinks. <H5>  Send Us Pressure Pipe, Not Experts </H5>  Both firms are interested, but are still busy looking for marketing possibilities in other nearby regions. Niitenberg thinks there are certain advantages to investing in Estonia. It is not like dealing with the Third World countries, who cannot manage on their own. We have technical know-how and an industrial infra-structure. All we need is modern technology.   In my dealings with foreigners, I have had to repeat, time and again, please believe me, we also have experts. We would rather have 300 meters of pressure pipe than seven experts, says Niitenberg, convinced that Estonia can offer some excellent specialists in the area of energetics. In addition to capital, we also lack the skill of organizing the work. <H5>  A Strategic Reserve Would Be Necessary </H5>  Lack of capital also stands in the way of creating a strategic reserve of fuel. Niitenberg is a believer in having strategic reserves, the only question being what is the most effective way of using the financial resources available. For Estonia to to maintain a three-month reserve of liquid fuel, would tie up $300 to $400 million.   Estonia is not rich enough to let such amounts sit idle. First, a decision needs to be made how much of a reserve should be maintained. This presumes that we know what we want to be insured against. We have the facilities for storing liquid fuel, but not for natural gas, 100 percent of which comes in from Russia. Putting those up would take an extremely large investment, the closest usable storage facilities are located in Latvia, Niitenberg says, adding that the question of strategic reserves has been discussed in government and has been assigned to the working group of the Economic Ministry. The problem is wider in scope, and includes the areas of medicine, food and other such. <H5>  Refining Plant To Cost $1 Billion </H5>  Canada, where Niitenberg worked for many years in leading positions within the energy system, had a relatively low level of reserves. Emphasis was placed on infra-structure, making sure that fuel could be moved immediately whenever needed. The reserves of liquid fuel were distributed between big oil companies, with the state keeping track of how fast some company or other could obtain a certain quantity of fuel. Most of the responsibility was borne by Petro Canada, a company similar to our Eesti KÆutus [Estonian Fuel]. There is always the question: Can the state place an obligation on a private company?   In case of a possible crisis, we have two choices. Either we have barrels stored somewhere, or we have a firm plan for how to transport the necessary amount of fuel from some refining plant in Denmark or Poland to Estonia within three days. Putting up our own plant would require a capital outlay of $800 to $900 million, whereas transportation, storage and other support services for import have improved significantly as of late.   In Canada, I dealt with electricity that could not be kept in reserve. For unexpected situations, alternatives had to be found, Niitenberg says. <H5>  A Nuclear Plant Does Not Have To Be Hazardous </H5>  Among specialists, there has also been talk about putting up a nuclear power plant in Estonia. Speaking of money, Niitenberg volunteered the cost of the Darlington nuclear power plant as an example. Ontario Hydro, the Canadian company where Niitenberg worked before coming to Estonia, and where he still has a position waiting for him, invested 14 billion Canadian dollars in building this 3,600 MW capacity power plant. This project, designed for an operating life of 30 to 40 years, is not expected to turn a profit for the first 10 years.   The possibility of putting up a nuclear power plant should be analyzed, above all, from an economic point of view. If the potential profit is a mere two cents per kilowatt, it will obviously not be worth the risk. It would be a completely different situation, however, if the nuclear plant would enable us to produce electricity at half the previous cost. One of the biggest burdens imaginable is a nuclear plant that does not work efficiently or does not have a sufficient load. However, atomic power plants can turn out to be extremely profitable. We should not dismiss any of the alternatives on simply emotional grounds, even though we know what happened at Chernobyl and what is going on in Paldiski, where the biggest danger is over by now, says Niitenberg, who was in charge of 20 nuclear power plants in Canada, and who has a daughter involved in liquidating nuclear power plant accidents.   As long as everything is well organized, this field is not as dangerous as it is thought to be. If that were not so, I would not have allowed my daughter to work in this field. It is significant that, in accordance with international agreements, information should be disclosed on any accident so that appropriate conclusions could be drawn by nuclear energy specialists in neighboring countries and throughout the world. At Chernobyl, this agreement was violated, Niitenberg explained. <H5>  Future Will Bring New Solutions </H5>  Niitenberg thinks that this issue will not come up on Estonia's agenda before the year 2000, for sure, and that it will take a political decision, in principle, either by politicians or by a referendum.   As far as the future of energetics for the whole world goes, Niitenberg does not deign offer anything specific.   If I knew the solution, I would become a very rich man, he laughs and thinks that bio-energetics will develop, for sure. Also feasible is the so-called fusion method, which is the next step in harnessing nuclear energy, based on the ability of heavy hydrogen isotopes to combine into helium at extremely high temperatures, yielding energy from the neutron thus released.   To the question about current fuel reserves and how long they will last, Niitenberg replies with another question: For what kind of money? Canada has supposedly more crude oil than all Arab countries combined but, due to natural conditions, pumping it out would cost 30 times more than the current norm. "}	english	default	1
FBIS3-43002	{"document_id": "FBIS3-43002","text": "Engineering Academy, B.Ye. Karasev, doctor of technical sciences and academician, International Information Academy, A.V. Logunov, corresponding member, International Engineering Academy, and V.D. Matyushin, candidate of technical sciences, NIID [expansion not given]; boldface as published in source text; UDC 502.7]   [Text] Under the conditions of continuous intensification of production, the problem of environmental protection and rational use of natural resources is becoming increasingly socially and economically significant. Included among the matters classified under this problem are the following: pollution of the water and air by toxic industrial wastes, toxic chemicals, and radioactive materials; prevention of harmful consequences of the use of pesticides to fight pests and diseases in agriculture and forestry; soil erosion and recultivation; further development of the legal bases of environmental protection; and economic assessment of natural resources.   The development of production, scientific and engineering progress, and expansion of human industrial activity must not destroy the harmony that has been established in nature or destroy natural resources. There are no wastes in nature: All biological, chemical, and physical processes occur in a closed circle.   All industrial enterprises affect the environment to some degree or other. Research has shown that at least one third of all processible raw material is now transformed into finished products. Consequently, the remaining fraction of raw materials becomes wastes that are often harmful to the environment. In the past decade, the volume of industrial wastes released into the atmosphere in conjunction with the rapid increase in industrial development has increased sharply and continues to increase. Each year, industrial enterprises, thermal electric power plants, motor vehicles, blast furnaces, aircraft engines, and other machines release hundreds of millions of tons of carbon in the form of oxides, primarily carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.   The carbon dioxide released by humans and the animal world is absorbed by plant life to provide a stable state of equilibrium in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, this equilibrium has now been upset, and the alarm of ecological catastrophe is sounding louder with each passing year. The continuing increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an especially negative phenomenon. Carbon dioxide is known to be toxic in large quantities: It causes hypoxia and debilitated respiration and cardiac activity. An increase in carbon dioxide concentration not only has a direct effect on organisms but also facilitates an increase in absorption of the earth's thermal radiation by the atmosphere, which in turn results in climate warming throughout the entire planet. As is known, in the past 100 years, the average temperature of the earth's surface increased by 0.5-0.6ë, which has in turn accelerated glacial thawing and increased the sea's level by 1.5-2 m.   Also released along with carbon dioxide during the combustion process is carbon monoxide, which has an even more toxic effect and which may result in debilitation of many vital functions, including illness of the central nervous system.   Metallurgy plants and thermal power plants release a large amount of sulfur dioxide. Fossil fuels also contain a great deal of sulfur. Each year, about 30 million tons of sulfurous gas are released in our country. When sulfur dioxide reacts with atmospheric moisture, sulfurous and sulfuric acids form. When nitrogen-containing coal and oil are burned, oxides are formed that combine with atmospheric moisture to yield nitrous and nitric acids. These acids may cause serious lung diseases.   Ecological and sanitary and hygiene estimates are formulated on the basis of data about emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere.   In nature, everything is interconnected. Toxic impurities that end up in the air are returned to the earth in the form of precipitation falling on pastures, meadows, fields, gardens, and vegetable gardens. Polluted precipitation also falls into water reservoirs. The acids contained in precipitation react with metals (aluminum, cadmium, mercury, lead, etc.) in the soil, and they infect the water and thus the fish.   Precipitation is not the only source of water pollution. Industrial, transport, and household wastes are dumped into water reservoirs in quantities such that many rivers and lakes can no longer be cleaned with existing resources. The natural purity of relatively shallow ground waters has been lost. Phosphates from wastes, the nitrates that are used everywhere as fertilizers, and other toxic materials have infiltrated them. The situation regarding irrigation water is no better. Its chemical composition largely dictates the quality of agricultural projects, in which the content of nitrates, phosphates, and metals has also risen. Countries with a high technological discipline permit the use of relatively small amounts of fertilizer. In countries with a lower technological discipline, the level is higher owing to an attempt to increase crop yields. As a rule, this results in a decline in product quality.   And so, the circle has closed: People harm the environment, the environment shortens their life. The child mortality rate in many countries has stopped decreasing, and in several countries it has even begun to increase. Studies conducted by the World Health Organization gave the sad results: An elevated lead content was discovered in the blood of 30 percent of neonates. Where is the way out?   Reason suggests that, as soon as possible, further destruction of nature must be halted, it must be restored on a planetwide scale, and population control must be begun so as not to extend beyond the scope of the biosphere's objective capabilities. Understanding of the fact that people's lives truly depend on their effect on nature has not yet become widespread.   It must be acknowledged that more than a few measures to regulate man's relationship with nature have been developed. In the developed countries, where the economy is subject to market relationships, energy-saving technologies are being developed intensively. This is making it possible to burn less fuel and, consequently, reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere. The manufacture of lead-free gasoline has begun, and exhaust gases have begun to contain far less toxic impurities.   Today, the search for ways of solving ecological problems is being conducted at the international, state, and sector levels. Many countries regularly exchange information about the current condition of the environment and are creating a common ecological data bank.   Unfortunately, our country has not yet become sufficiently actively engaged in this process. And the situation in our country cannot be called good. According to existing data, about 30 million of our citizens are living in ecological disaster areas. Life itself is compelling us to consider the problems of restoring and protecting nature as priority problems.   Quality sewage treatment is not provided in 600 cities, more than two thirds of toxic sources do not meet the requirements specified in standards. Volumes of unutilizable toxic industrial wastes are increasing, and a large portion of them are transported to household waste dumps or else to disorganized storage sites, which eventually results in toxic materials ending up in underground waters and water reservoirs and in infection of the plant and animal world.   Unfortunately, the aviation industry, whose technical policy has long failed to recognize ecology as a priority directly, is a definite contributor to these negative consequences of economic activity.   Each year, about 290,000 tons of toxic materials in the form of gases released from stationary sources are formed throughout the sector as a whole. From them, dust- and gas-scrubbing units trap 136,500 tons of toxic materials (47.1 percent), and 153,700 tonnes, i.e., about 0.25 percent of the total volume of wastes throughout the country, are released into the atmosphere. Considering the fact that the sector's enterprises are located in cities with an industrially developed potential, where tough standards are in effect, and also, as a rule, in densely populated complexes of apartment buildings, the negative effect of the sector's production on the environment is not always adequately reflected by the volumes of emissions of toxic materials. In the total mass of emissions, the greatest volume percentage of pollutants comes from boiler and other thermal power plants (36-40 percent), foundry work (15-18 percent), painting (14-15 percent), and engine ground tests (14-15 percent). The sector's production is characterized by a long list of wastes. And although solid particles and hydrocarbons predominate in the composition of toxic materials generated (they account for 74.6 and 13 percent respectively), individual enterprises release up to 70 different toxic elements and compounds into the air medium.   Each year, about 3,800,000 tons of ash, slag, spend molding and core mixtures, sediments in cleaning equipment, and other wastes are generated at the sector's enterprises. Of that amount, 800,000 tons is toxic. Hundreds of thousands of tons of abrasive dust containing cobalt, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, chromium, nickel, vanadium, and other metals that are needed for industry but are nevertheless harmful to the environment are released each year.   According to data from a 1992 inventory of sector enterprises throughout Moscow, the total volume of toxic wastes generated consists of the following: 33 percent are wastes of galvanic and other types of chemical treatment; 17 percent are petroleum products (oils, cutting fluids, and storm sewer slimes); 12 percent are wastes containing highly toxic heavy metals (dusts, slags, slimes); 8 percent are spent liquid organic solvents, highly flammable liquids, and vat sediments left after regeneration of solvents; 5 percent are wastes from paint and varnish production; and 21 percent are other toxic wastes.   The problems of ecological improvement of the sector's production and creation of new resource-saving low-waste technologies and equipment have not yet become basic and binding. It should be noted, however, that the sector's institutes are definitely working in this direction.   The development and introduction into the sector of fluxless melting of magnesium alloys and mechanization of their casting by using vacuum furnaces with a gas shield have made it possible to significantly reduce protection of the air medium and reduce the toxicity of wastes (slags). Also noteworthy from the standpoint of protection of the air medium and reduction of the toxicity of production wastes (slags) is the development of a process and equipment for vacuum preparation (degassing) of aluminum alloys instead of the process of refining them in layers. The process has been introduced on a wide scale at aviation industry enterprises and in other sectors.   Work to replace graphite during the shaped casting of titanium alloys by artificial corundum by using titanium powder obtained from titanium wastes as a coating is now under way. This will reduce the use of toxic binders (synthetic resins).   From an ecology standpoint, work to create processes and equipment for progressive automated high-precision methods of casting metals and alloys with complete regeneration, recovery, and neutralization of the wastes generated and to introduce them at sector enterprises should become a priority in foundry work.   In the past few years, the following ecologically promising low-waste processes and equipment for heat-treating components have been introduced by sector enterprises: ion nitriding of components used in basic production; vacuum nitriding of screws and cylinders made of titanium alloys; and heat treating magnesium alloy castings in ecologically pure media (in a vacuum or sulfur hexafluoride gas). This has made it possible to cut emissions of toxic materials by a factor of 2-3.   In the area of machining, the NIID [expansion not given; Defectology Scientific Research Institute (?)] and sector enterprises have jointly developed and introduced the following low-waste processes and equipment:   -- a resource-saving process involving the use of domestic cutting fluids instead of imported ones in the operations of grinding the blanks of components made of difficult-to-machine materials that has simultaneously doubled/tripled the duration of cutting fluid use and permitted effective cleaning of oil residues from the water in spent cutting fluids. The cost savings has been in the vicinity of 850,000 rubles;   -- an ecologically pure process for applying reinforcing coatings on a cutting tool by the vacuum ion-plasma method that has made it possible to boost a tool's wear resistance by a factor of 5 or 6;   -- a process for diamond and artificial diamond grinding of blades that has made it possible to reduce dust by 40 percent;   -- a briquetting process based on the use of plastics (glass-filled polyamide) to automate and mechanize the manufacture of blades at a number of the subsector's enterprises instead of toxic and scarce materials (alloys of the Wood's type);   -- a process for finishing precision components of fuel-regulating equipment by using honing heads instead of finishing treatment with abrasive pastes that has reduced consumption of abrasives and, consequently, their release into the atmosphere by a factor of 3.   In the area of installing and testing on-board systems, the following have been developed:   -- ecologically pure processing for checking leaktightness based on aqueous solutions of surfactants with color indication instead of the oil-and-whiting method;   -- a stand to check the hydraulic characteristics of pneumatic-hydraulic system components by using demineralized water and a stand for comprehensive development of pneumatic-hydraulic systems by using distillate and neural gas (nitrogen) instead of highly toxic working fluids and expensive helium.   In the area of magnetic testing methods, work to introduce television-magnetic inspection of series-produced components was done in 1990-1992. This type of inspection may replace the x-ray and magnetic powder methods for simply shaped components made of magnetic materials and would make it possible to eliminate the use of x-radiation and single-use x-ray films from the inspection operation, as well as eliminate developer and fixative wastes. In the case of the television-magnetic method, there are no wastes, and the magnetic tape may be used multiple times.   Completion of the aforesaid projects will make it possible to reduce the release of toxic materials (finely dispersed dust, nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc.) into the atmosphere, eliminate contamination of the atmosphere and water reservoirs by highly flammable liquids and pollution of the atmosphere by the volatile components of paints and varnishes, improve the sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor, reduce pollution of water sources by petroleum products, etc.   Despite the definite work conducted by the sector with respect to ecological improvement of production and creation of new low-waste processes, it is, as is evident from the above data, still difficult to call this activity purposive and effective.   To a certain extent, significant ecological problems arise during aviation operations. The greenhouse gases CO[.sup]2[/], water vapor, and NO[.sub]x[/] nitric oxides form as kerosene burns in an aircraft engine. Efforts are currently under way to improve combustion chambers to reduce nitrogen oxide wastes.   The only way of significantly reducing or completely eliminating these wastes, however, is to use cryogenic fuel such as liquefied natural gas or liquid hydrogen. The development of cryogenic fuel-based aviation will make it possible to eliminate aviation's dependence on diminishing petroleum reserves.   Development and assimilation of the following processes/equipment are planned as priority directions of ecological improvement over the next few years:   -- ecologically pure processes and equipment to wash components and subassemblies with aqueous solutions of commercial detergents instead of gasoline, kerosene, and other health-damaging materials that will simultaneously make it possible to economize fuel and raw material resources;   -- a process and equipment for applying powder polymer coatings onto gas turbine engine components in an electrostatic field that will make it possible to eliminate paint solvent vapors and aerosols in the atmosphere;   -- systems to evacuate and recover the chloride gas medium used when producing diffusion coatings on gas turbine engine components by the circulation method from the gaseous phase that will result in an ecologically pure technological process;   -- a process and equipment for creating ecologically pure technological media for high-temperature soldering of refractory alloys to reduce the formation of fluoride compounds by a factor of 6-8;   -- a process and automated chambers for microcomputer-controlled high-energy plasma-torch spraying of coatings to reduce the labor required for the soldering process by 25 percent on average.   These efforts will make it possible to accomplish the following: reduce emissions of toxic materials (finely dispersed dust, nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc.) into the atmosphere; eliminate pollution of the atmosphere and water reservoirs; improve the sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor; eliminate pollution of the atmosphere by paint material components; and reduce pollution of water sources by petroleum products.   The development of science-intensive processes and equipment and their introduction into industry are still far from adequate. One of the main distinguishing features of science-intensive technologies and production is the fact that they require little raw material and energy (i.e., they are more resource-saving); therefore, the wastes generated when they are used are not great. Water consumption in these processes is also much lower than in conventional industrial processes, which ultimately reduces the amount of contaminated sewage.   Membrane, ultrasound, laser, plasma, high-speed machining, and progressive casting are among those resource-saving low-waste and science-intensive processes that are especially significant for the sector's production on an ecological plane.   The sector's lack of a systems approach to solving these problems is another very important reason why the work that is being done with respect to ecological improvement of industry and creation of new types of resource-saving low-waste processes has not been effective enough.   According to the standard international classification system, the aviation sector is among the 10 most science-intensive sectors. It is understood that the task of switching the industry over to science-intensive low-waste processes in the present period under the conditions of the systems of economic relationships that have developed in the sector, where the business agreement with enterprises has by and large become the main source of financing R&amp;D, is rather difficult.   One of the main priority tasks related to organizing a systems approach is that of developing a special integrated environmental protection program. The foundation of this program consists of measures geared toward ecological improvement of the sector's existing production and creation of new resource-saving low-waste processes with mandatory expert examination in all stages of development, introduction, and dissemination for the purpose of clarifying their ecological feasibility.   The technological measures planned by the sector should be based on priority directions, including those in the field of ecological improvement of the sector's production as determined first and foremost by the list of enterprises, types of production and processes, and materials with the biggest negative effect on the environment.   The technology section of the sector's integrated ecology program must contain a number of subprograms in different directions of environmental protection activity. Specifically, each subsector must have a separate program of operations to create a process and equipment for regenerating, recovering, and neutralizing production and consumption wastes.   Expert ecological examination must be given a great deal of attention as a tool that makes it possible to make a scientifically well founded decision regarding the need to develop new technologies, as well as the need to replace and further develop ecologically imperfect technological processes, equipment, and materials that are in use.   In addition, it is necessary to have a system that makes it possible to conduct expert evaluations and prevent possible negative ecological and economic consequences of the effect of the sector's production on the environment. What is needed most on this plane is coordination of the efforts of sector institutes in accordance with their specialization as a part of the methodological, standards and related reference information, and technical-organizational support of such an expert evaluation, which should be mandatory for all associations and enterprises. The expert evaluation should be based on a comprehensive study of the effect on the environment in several directions, i.e., the effect on the air in the work zone's atmosphere, water consumption, generation of solid waste, etc.   The sector's institutes now have the materials required to conduct expert evaluations. For example, they now have the following: normative-reference material related to determining indicators for an ecological-economic evaluation of the sector's manufacturing facilities from the standpoint of contamination of all industrial sewage; normative-reference material related to the basic manufacturing processes and allocation of water with consideration for its quality; a method of calculating the quantitative characteristics of emissions of toxic materials into the atmosphere from the basic types of manufacturing equipment at the sector's enterprises; a normative-methodological list of indicators of emissions of materials that pollute the atmosphere and civil aviation motors for use in ecological evaluations and forecasts; and sector methodological guidelines regarding calculating toxic emissions form aircraft engines. The Russian Federation Ministry of Health and other industrial sectors also have a number of methodological materials.   A group of environmental protection specialists at the NIID are conducting a systematic check of completed scientific research work and newly developed and improved technological processes to analyze their effect on the environment and their conformity to the requirements of environmental protection legislation so as to prevent the introduction of technological processes that do not meet the requirements of environmental protection and rational use of natural resources.   The training of engineering personnel both in institutes and in enterprises for the purpose of providing them with the required body of modern ecological knowledge acquires great importance in this respect.   Only when specialists have in-depth knowledge of the interaction of nature and society, the consequences of industrial pollution of the environment, rational methods and ways of using nature, the requirements of environmental protection legislation, ways of protecting the environment against industrial emissions, ways of estimating the damage done to nature, and other matters will they be capable of actively introducing expert ecological examinations into the sector, increasing its quality, and consequently producing a product that is not ecologically harmful.   Purposive and effective work toward ecological improvement of the sector's production based on resource-saving and low-waste technology is impossible without significant improvement of organizational work in this direction.   In this regard, special attention must be paid to developing organizational methodological materials to support the use of recyclable material resources in the national economy.   The problem of increasing the effectiveness and rational use of recyclable material resources is one of the most important problems in the sector's production. Hundreds of thousands of tons of recyclable material resources pile up at the sector's enterprises each year. Table 1 presents the volumes of the generation, use, and destruction of recyclable material resources in the sector in 1991. It is evident from Table 1 that between 4 and 83 percent of recyclable material resources is destroyed depending on the type of resource. The main thrust of the sector's economic strategy is effective use of recyclable material resources in production, the main directions of which are presented in Table 2. "}	english	default	1
FBIS3-43108	{"document_id": "FBIS3-43108","text": "The increasing stringency of the requirements imposed on the economic and environmental indicators of aircraft gas turbine engines (AGTD) brought to the forefront the issue of using liquefied hydrogen or natural gas as motor fuel which calls for preliminary fuel gasification in a special heat exchanger. The development of such heat exchangers-gasifiers is fraught with a number of problems, e.g., selecting the heat exchanger location, ensuring a stable cryogenic fuel flow in the heat exchanger channels, selecting the fuel preheating regime, etc. The solution to these problems is complicated by a lack of reliable design methods. To bridge this gap, an attempt is made to develop an analysis technique using the example of heat exchanger-gasifiers for NK-88 and NK-89 engines. The design of the heat exchanger and heat and mass transfer processes during cryogenic fuel gasification are described in detail, a mathematical model of the process is formulated, and an algorithm for solving the resulting equations is proposed. The analytical method of designing heat exchangers for cryogenic fuel gasification with two-phase flow conditions inside the pipes and frosting on the outside surface is verified experimentally. The maximum spread between the analytical and experimental data is within 15-25% which attests to the mathematical model's adequacy for practical applications.

FBIS3-41958	{"document_id": "FBIS3-41958","text": "It has increased its research effort in the sectors it covers and, something new, it is working as an agency by publishing and distributing the results of its activities throughout Italy.   With over 5,000 employees, nine large research centers, and other smaller areas where it is working, ENEA [Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and the Environment] is present throughout Italy.   Amongst its new lines of intervention there are plans for the transfer and distribution of innovation to production, industry and agriculture, the development of components and technologies for the utilization of renewable sources of energy and energy saving, as well as research and experimentation of innovative nuclear reactors that are safer than those of the past.   This redefinition of its areas of competence is laying the foundations for the ENEA of the year 2000. It will be a producer of technological and managerial culture, and be at the service, in particular, of the manufacturing world.   Nicola Cabibbo, whom we have interviewed, has recently been called to direct this research giant. He is a scientist who is well known and respected by the international scientific community, and has come from the presidency of the INFN [Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics].   Prestipino: Prof. Cabibbo, the handbook of the new ENEA is definitely the 1993-95 three-year program, that was published in December 1992 and presents the programs and new objectives of the agency in 115 pages. How much of this reflects the situation of the old agency and how much describes the new one?   Cabibbo: Let us say immediately that this is a sliding plan, that has suffered from the time when it was drawn up, and allows for changes of direction as it goes along. The developments of the coming years will influence the way it is followed.   Prestipino: It has been said that the plan is already old or that anyway it reflects the ideas of the old agency.   Cabibbo: When I arrived at the ENEA I did not consider reviewing the plan because it is a lengthy procedure. Perhaps I will participate in the preparation of the next one. Let us not forget that it has been approved at ministerial level.   I think that it is very important for the agency to focus its activities better. Its nuclear activity having been interrupted, ENEA has found itself without the burden of this institutional duty. From this point of view the reform law of August 1991 is to be viewed very positively since it gave the agency precise goals. Nuclear energy was an enormous job that required commitment, involved great responsibility, care for the environment, and the development of advanced technologies.   Now my idea is to focus and gather the various initiatives around major projects, in a context that is easier to understand so that the objectives to be pursued are clearer.   The structural elements are still there. I mean to say, there is still the expertise in the energy field, and the fields of related problems, from the rational use of energy, to the alternative sources, to nuclear energy and so on.   Prestipino: So is it a plan without an itinerary that is to be reviewed as it goes along?   Cabibbo: Certainly. In the environmental field for example, a central problem is that of working in harmony with the others who are involved in this field. Let us not forget that there are about 3,000 researchers scattered around in various research centers working on the environment in Italy, and that about 800 of them are in ENEA.   Prestipino: Could ENEA have a role to play in this harmonization process?   Cabibbo: In the environmental field work is also done for projects. It is clear that ENEA will launch its own projects, like the one on the Mediterranean Basin that was presented at the end of September at our marine research center at Santa Teresa.   Yes, in some ways we put ourselves forward as promoters and coordinators, a little like we are for the Antarctic, but we are always ready to compare what we are doing with what others are doing.   Instead, that which ENEA can specifically provide and make available to safeguard the environment, on the one hand is systems ability, and on the other is technological ability. These two riches permit ENEA to take on important roles, at a global level, in programs that do not take single aspects into consideration, but that consider the environmental problems as a whole, since they are necessarily interconnected and often require multidisciplinary interventions and collaboration with other countries. For example, Spain is very interested in collaborating with us, and France, being very active in the environmental field, is already doing so.   Prestipino: Amongst the strategies for the renewal of the agency, what effect will the new line that you announced have on the use of the APE [Array Processor Experiment] super computer?   Cabibbo: The super computer is a central element for the transfer of scientific knowledge to major applications, ranging from those of the environment such as meteorology and climatic changes, to those of great technological interest such as metallurgy and combustion processes. ENEA has ordered a large parallel computer capable of performing 100 billion operations per second, an APE Quadrics, produced by Alenia Spazio under license from the INFN. At present it is the most powerful parallel computer available in the world and the technology is entirely Italian.   We have also ordered six small Quadrics that will either be used for developing programs or for new types of applications, made possible by the availability of the power of a super computer that has the size and advantages of a work station.   Prestipino: Will the super computer also be used in the energy sector?   Cabibbo: Certainly. For example, one of the problems that we are carefully studying in the energy field is that of combustion and this requires a combination of experimental techniques and numerical simulation. The trend is to consider the experimental techniques as the validation of the simulation techniques. The latter, in fact, are much richer, and permit a more detailed and careful study. ENEA has a very important experimental combustion center at Casaccia. We are trying to integrate this experimental center, so that it forms part of a more complete picture that will involve the use, once the Quadrics computer is available, of numerical simulation. This will put us in the vanguard.   Prestipino: At this stage of renewal, while the structure of the agency is being planned out on a grand scale, what would be a burden and what would be helpful?   Cabibbo: Compared to other agencies, ENEA is divided into large research centers, such as those at Casaccia and Frascati near Rome, Saluggia in Piemonte, Trisaia in Basilicata, Brasimone in the Tuscan-Emilian Appenines, Portico in Campania, Santa Teresa in Liguria and Bologna. This structure creates, on one hand, a managerial and organizational burden, but on the other it offers the advantage of being able to put an imposing striking force into the field to work on specific problems that require the simultaneous use and synergy of various types of expertise. This is what ENEA has always done in the past for the complex programs for nuclear power stations.   A very interesting program that has been recently managed by ENEA has been the Antarctic Project. The agency was able to pour its technical-scientific and managerial ability into this program. ENEA received merit for having enabled Italy to present itself on the international scene in full dress. A modern base was constructed in a short time and the quality of the research programs carried out has allowed us to become one of the nations of the Antarctic Treaty with full rights, and to collaborate, with equal scientific dignity, with the other countries that are already present, such as the United States and France. But the Antarctic program is a paradigm from another point of view in the sense that ENEA does not deal only with those aspects that it finds more congenial, such as the systems engineering and logistics that require extremely complex operations and the use of advanced technologies, but does so in close collaboration with other research bodies. The scientific program is multidisciplinary, and ENEA, although it is also present at this level, has a minor position with respect to the CNR [Italian National Research Council] and the universities that play the major part.   Prestipino: What direction will the new ENEA take, will it turn toward pure research or to a closer collaboration with industry?   Cabibbo: It will pass through research, but also through its applications. ENEA is able to do valid research and as the institutional duties of ENEA also include direct interventions, such as those on the environment, we are directing our work toward the concrete problems of the country. In order for this to be possible and for it to give the results that are wanted, the agency must have strong research components.   Prestipino: How is the agency preparing for its new duties? How are the personnel and the engineers being retrained?   Cabibbo: Technical abilities are easily transferable, particularly when you are working in complex sectors. For example, the director of the Antarctic program is a nuclear engineer. New expertise is certainly necessary to enter new fields, but the possibility of self training is also to be valorized.   When we think about training we also think about it as a further field of service that ENEA could offer the national community.   [Cabibbo continues] For example, today there is an extensive request for training that has arisen from local requirements for new expertise, resulting from the necessity to look after certain aspects of the safeguarding of the environment and to increase energy saving. ENEA has a wealth of expertise to offer in these sectors.   Prestipino: In a certain sense the reform law has put ENEA on the market, pushing it to find its own funding for autonomous survival. How is it doing?   Cabibbo: I would say well. One third of the funding is covered by collaboration programs with the ministries and with the European Community. It is enough to consider that, in terms of funding, international commissions entrusted to ENEA amount to about 120 billion per year.   Prestipino: The south of Italy, what lines of intervention are planned for this area by ENEA?   Cabibbo: ENEA is moving toward the actuation of the agreement on the Mezzogiorno [southern Italy] Program. For example we have already taken on 55 of the projected 80 researchers. At present we are waiting, but in the meantime we are working on a new collaboration agreement with the ministry of scientific research.   We are not so interested in the value of the initiative being discussed, as we are in its ends, the goals of such a collaboration.   Prestipino: Energy. What is ENEA doing at an international level to have safe nuclear energy?   Cabibbo: Examining and reviewing current nuclear technologies following the referendum is of dramatic importance for ENEA.   An interesting point is that our European partners, in particular Germany, that were reluctant to accept the commitment to a new generation of reactors are now more disposed to do so. Work is being done on a new project at a European level. ENEA intends making its own contribution to this project, the EPR (European Pressurized Reactor), because it seems to meet our requirements in terms of social acceptability.   The safety characteristics of new reactors can no longer be expressed in terms of probabilities. The design must be such as to guarantee that even the biggest possible accident has no consequences, either for the environment, or for the population.   The research for these new generation power stations must continue to lead to reactors that are intrinsically safe, with which, in the worst case, it would be possible to lose the reactor itself, but without emissions outside the plant that were above the safety level. The construction of these plants, already technologically possible, depends on a number of factors, these being high costs, social acceptability, and the problems of managing them. ENEA's research program is very limited with respect to what the agency was doing in the 'eighties, also because the new reactors require development and certification at a European level, if not at a world level. This is not a road that we can take alone.   Prestipino: Alternative forms of energy. Other countries have moved on to their commercialization. In Italy we are still at the research stage. What does ENEA intend to do?   Cabibbo: The renewable sources that ENEA is concerned with are wind energy and the energy that can be obtained from biomasses, such as garbage. They are already competitive, particularly if the social costs (pollution etc.) of the traditional sources of energy are taken into account. However, with respect to what is technologically possible today, Italy is behind as far as the use of energy derived from the wind is concerned.   It is necessary to provide incentives for the construction and use of this type of equipment, as has been done in Denmark and the United Kingdom, guaranteeing those that use the equipment (usually small producers) that their energy will be purchased. ENEA has collaborated with two Italian industries in the research and development for the construction of various models that are slightly different from those used in the northern European countries because of the lower wind speeds found in our regions. Denmark and the United Kingdom are demonstrating that already today it is possible to produce abundant energy from the wind, and to do so at competitive prices.   The time is also ripe for us to make the jump in quality from research to industrial application. It is one thing to construct a single prototype unit generating energy from the wind and it is another to construct a hundred, being able to count on the economies of scale.   Prestipino: And solar energy?   Cabibbo: Solar energy is less conventional than wind energy. The energy produced by solar power plants has a higher cost. It is an interesting technology for certain specialized applications, such as isolated houses. However, it still cannot make an impact on the energy consumption of the country.   Solar panels that are cheaper than those currently available are necessary if their use is to have a relevant impact. Once we have gotten over this problem, the solution to which could be found in the coming years, (ENEA is doing a lot of work in this direction, both at the Portici center and in collaboration with other countries) the photovoltaic cell will become very desirable, both for ecological motives, and from the aesthetic point of view. Let us not forget that wind-powered generators have been strongly contested in the United Kingdom because, according to some environmentalists, the blades of the windmills disfigure the countryside.   Prestipino: In conclusion, Prof. Cabibbo, where is ENEA going? How will it respond to the many older employees who are retiring early? How will the agency be renewed?   Cabibbo: ENEA is still feeling the influence of nuclear energy, which required an organizational set-up that is too burdensome today. As an agency that dedicates itself to other activities it will be necessary to adjust the team.   The early retirements would be very positive if it were possible to bring young people into the agency. At present we can only hire about 10 percent with respect to the number of people who are leaving. An ideal turnover figure would be 20/30 percent. Without hiring young people, the agency is getting older. Two thousand people will be leaving and it will be necessary to hire at least 600 young people during the next 10 years. "}	english	default	1
FBIS3-42460	{"document_id": "FBIS3-42460","text": "Having studied the properties of water, S. Benson and E. Siebert (University of Southern California at Los Angeles) have arrived at the conclusion that the molecules of this liquid do not jostle randomly, but form short-lived networks in the shape of cubes of eight molecules and rings of four molecules. The cubes and rings are then formed into chains and networks.   Experimental data obtained for the hard and gas phases were used to construct a theoretical model of water in the liquid phase. The chemists claim that the microstructures they discovered help explain some of the unusual properties of water, such as its ability to absorb large amounts of heat and its ability to expand on freezing.   Most liquids fall into one of two categories: they are either regular or structured. The molecules in regular liquids form relatively weak bonds in pairs under the impact of van der Waals forces. Because these forces do not have a particular direction, the molecules are free to adopt any orientation relative to one another to fill free space. The organic solvent tetrachloromethane is an example of such a liquid. Such liquids, the molecules of which are held together by stronger, oriented forces, are among the regular liquids. Usually, these are hydrogen bonds, which form between a slightly positive hydrogen atom in one molecule and an oxygen atom with a weak negative charge in a neighboring molecule.   Structured liquids cannot be described by the simple empirical formulas that are used to describe the physical properties of regular liquids. For example, each molecule in a regular liquid with closely packed molecules can be surrounded by 10-11 others. In a structured liquid, there can be as few as 4-5 of these molecules and therefore sufficient free space remains between molecules.   The American scientists think that water is possibly the most extreme representative of a structured liquid. It has maximum density at a temperature of 4ëC and an unexpectedly high heat capacity. After many years of debates, scientists arrived at the conclusion that hydrogen bonds are the cause of the anomalous properties of water, however, there is still no adequate theory that precisely predicts water's heat capacity and fluidity or explains such a property of water as its low density in solid state.   Benson and Siebert claim that with their new octamer-tetramer model of intermolecular hydrogen bonds permits them to predict the physical characteristics of water in the entire range of temperatures of the existence of the liquid phase (from 0 to 100ëC) with an accuracy of up to 2% with regard to experimental data.   The scientists do not claim that water consists exclusively of cubic and ring bonds of molecules, but they think that these are the simplest and most widespread types of bonds. Instruments do not yet exist that permit us to record such formations because the hydrogen bonds between water molecules form and break with a frequency of 500 Ghz.   Benson and Siebert say that water might also contain other structures--such as cyclic pentamers (five molecules in a ring) or decameric sandwich dimers. But they also admit that there is no evidence of the existence of these microstructures, except for calculations of thermal and volumetric properties which match experimental data.   The proposed microstructural theory also explains water's anomalous behavior when other substances are added. Although the presence of simple hydrogen bonds predicts that a polar substance such as ammonia gives off heat when it dissolves in water, it cannot explain why this occurs even when nonpolar tetrachloromethane dissolves.

FBIS3-42749	{"document_id": "FBIS3-42749","text": "Vitaliy Mikhaylovich, the subject of our discussion is the present and probable future of Moldovan energy engineering. But first--about the conflict between you and the institute's scientific council, which has been given unjustifiably broad publicity. You are accused of abuse of power, protectionism, incorrect use of funds allotted to the institute, and other sins. With the exception of the one article in MOLODEZH MOLDOVY, from the other publications the readers received essentially one-sided information about the essence of the conflict. And your silence in this situation seems somewhat strange.   [Postolatiy] I admit that among the accusations that have been hurled at me there are some that are fair. But in the flow of fabrications, squabbles, and fact juggling they make up too small a part to cause us to believe that my opponents are really concerned about affairs of the institute and the development of energy engineering in Moldova.   I have nothing against sweeping the garbage out of the hut and placing it in the garbage can. But my colleagues and subordinates have spread it out in the street for everyone to see, brought in garbage from the outside, and they shout: Look at how neat and clean we are! It seemed to me that my differences with that part of them, namely the part of the scholarly council, was a matter for within the institute. Therefore, if you will, out of delicacy I did not make a statement in response. Then, when the mass attack against me was turned into a witch hunt it was not easy to find a publication that would publish the arguments of the other side in spite of the relatively well-developed public opinion.   [Valentik] Well, you have found such a publication. So what is the essence of the conflict?   [Postolatiy] Last year the Ministry of the National Economy allotted us less money than was anticipated. I raised the question of its distribution at the scholarly council of the institute, which on 5 May adopted a decision regarding this issue. In particular, it decided to freeze certain work under the state order. And the job of dealing with the workers discharged in this was magnanimously assigned to the director. There was only one solution: to reduce the number of workers by 25-30 percent. But for our recently created institute it would be a great mistake to lose skilled personnel even in such an extreme situation. The general meeting of institute workers convened on my initiative arrived at the same opinion. Moreover, note, there was not a single objection. They started pouring down when on 31 May I issued an order for redistribution of budget funds taking the real situation into account. Certain members of the scholarly council regarded this as the director's disrespect for the decision they had adopted previously and they declared war on me.   [Valentik] So first the scholarly council decided to reveal the truth by a majority of votes and then they decided to clarify it by an even larger majority.   [Postolatiy] I set a more modest task for myself--to preserve the collective and fulfill the plan for scientific research work as completely as possible.   [Valentik] As I understand it, the council is created in order to advise the director, and not to make decisions for him. You are the leader but, excuse me, not God's dandelion blown by the breath of others' opinions. Were you not motivated by a desire to share with the council the responsibility for the institute's affairs.   [Postolatiy] Whatever the advice from the scholarly council may be, the responsibility is placed squarely on the shoulders of the director. In this case I did not want to make a decision that was not in keeping with the interests of the matter. After that it went like this...the Ministry of Economics granted us the right to change the volume of work. As a result of adjustments that were made the financial situation in the institute improved somewhat. Moreover, in conjunction with the scholarly council, we managed to decide the fate of the workers who had been left without wages. Now it was possible to adopt the council's previous recommendations of 5 May. I made this compromise for the sake of the cause. But not all the members of the scholarly council were satisfied with this outcome of the matter. As they say, give them an inch and they will take a mile. And they began an even more vicious attack on the director. August and September were a time when the institute was overwhelmed with full inspections. Defamatory statements, anonymous letters, and other charming things like this came pouring in. But not a single proposal about improving the institute's work was received from our opponents. There followed a resolution according to which the laboratory headed by the director was left essentially without funds.   [Valentik] In that case you could sooner be accused of inability to wield power than abuse of it. As far as I know, even your irreconcilable enemies are not accusing you of incompetence or of violating the law either. The presidium of the Academy of Sciences considered you worthy of heading the institute in the future. And you probably cannot be held to blame for the thoughtlessness of members of the presidium. Why are your opponents still unable to make peace? What are they trying to achieve?   [Postolatiy] Some of them want anyone at all to be the director as long as it is not me.   [Valentik] But since you are the director, let us get down to business. In my view, something strange is happening with Moldova's energy potential now. The republic ships in almost all its fuel (98 percent) from other countries. It ships in less each year: in 1991--13 million tonnes of conventional fuel, in 1992--11.6 million. The output of electric energy is dropping correspondingly: from 13.2 billion kilowatt-hours in 1991 to 11.1 billion in 1992. In 1990 we produced 16 billion kilowatt-hours of electric energy. It was sufficient, but no more than that. Now the deficit is being felt in all spheres of the republic's life. The population has been deprived of hot water. The heating batteries are not heated to their full capacity. In order to avoid paying outrageous prices for electric energy, pensioners use stearine candles. Yet Moldova exports electric energy abroad. Particularly to Romania and Bulgaria.   [Postolatiy] Our institute has nothing to do with the redistribution of fuel and electric energy. But do not forget that commercial structures now have the right to purchase energy sources and produce energy from them. They use some of it at their own discretion. As for the state sector, here the situation is different: Because of the sharp decline in production a kind of reserve of energy capacity has been created.   [Valentik] So perhaps my colleague from the newspaper TSARA is right when, referring to the opinion of experts, he writes that If we had an energy system with high-voltage lines in the countries of Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Turkey) we could export electric energy at advantageous prices and at the same time obtain a profit of approximately $50-70 million.   [Postolatiy] In the first place, as one can see from his article, your colleague is confusing kilowatts with kilovolts; in the second place, apparently, he met his match in the experts. If you build a high-voltage transmission line, the immediate reason for doing so lies not in Turkey or Bulgaria, but in Moldova--with the prospect of entering the unified European energy system. As for the reserves of electric energy that have now been formed, this is a temporary, ephemeral phenomenon. The predictions of real specialists tell us that the consumption of fuel and energy resources by 1995 in our country will reach the 1990 level and will grow in accordance with the increase in production volumes. Here it is necessary to take into account that the proportional expenditure of energy resources on the manufacture of a unit of output in our country exceeds world indicators by 1.5-2 times. And our industry can hardly count on utilizing advanced energy-saving technologies--at least in the next decade.   The situation now is such that our energy sector is being finished off as they try to skim of the good parts. And this is at a time when 44 percent of the republic's energy equipment has outlived its service life and needs to be replaced. We are burning our fixed capital, which is in need of modernization and development, for the sake of momentary advantage.   We have an immense deficit in the financing of energy deliveries. The handling capacity of the republic's external electrical communications with our neighbors, especially Romania, is clearly inadequate. The schedule for loading in the energy system is not uniform--the fluctuations reach 30-40 percent of the maximum. In the next few years the situation could develop in such a way that energy engineering in Moldova will not be in a condition to provide the economy with electricity and heat in a balanced way. And they are talking to us about tens of millions in profit for exported electric energy!   The basis of the strategic development of energy engineering is the provision of a self-balance of electric and thermal capacities. Calculations show that it will always be more advantageous to buy fuel resources than to import pure energy. This means that the development of generating capacities must become one of the most important areas in the development of energy engineering.   [Valentik] In such an alarming situation, why are the funds received from the sale of electric energy abroad by the state sector not invested in the development of the republic's energy engineering? That would be only fair.   [Postolatiy] That is necessary. But that question is not for me but for the republic government.   [Valentik] Let us say that I asked it of the government. Vitaliy Mikhaylovich, the demand: Give us what we need--today! is the curse of all basic sciences. Your science, perhaps more than others, can be regarded as an applied science. What can your Institute do for Moldovan energy engineering today?   [Postolatiy] Practical return is very important. But without basic research we would have nothing to give. The work of all 11 of the institute's laboratories encompasses problems of energy engineering almost to a maximum. They include modelling the development of energy systems and conditions for their operation; reliability of energy supply; controlled electricity distribution; microprocessor control systems; diagnostics of energy equipment; electro-physics and high voltage technology; controlled electric energy accumulators; economics, energy saving, automation, the application of computer equipment, etc.   Along with other organizations we have drawn up a draft program for the development of energy engineering of Moldova up to the year 2010 and submitted it to the republic government. Speaking on the whole, the main direction of the institute's activity is to increase the effectiveness of energy systems and energy supply systems.   [Valentik] It is known that you assign a significant role in the development of Moldovan energy engineering to extensive introduction of USVL (controlled self-compensating high voltage electric power transmission lines) and varieties of them--SVL [self-compensating high voltage power transmission lines] and VLSF [expansion not identified]. But some members of your institute's scholarly council have their doubts about the effectiveness of these lines and certain specialists from similar departments think that their introduction into practice is unpromising. Essentially the same conclusion was reached by the commission of the republic's Academy of Sciences.   [Postolatiy] At the beginning of our discussion you correctly noted that it is impossible to establish the truth by a majority of votes. So I am convinced that the USVL and varieties of it are the immediate future for Moldovan energy engineering, and not just Moldovan. This is also shown by experience with their practical utilization.   It would take us 10 years to convince specialists that, particularly with respect to power transmission lines with a voltage of 10 kilovolts, it would be possible to place high-voltage supports every 90-100 meters instead of 60-70. Now we will probably have to--God forbid that this will take 10 years too--convince many of my colleagues of the need to use USVL. And yet these lines provide for considerably greater reliability of electric power supply. Their application reduces the number of power failures by 30 percent, it reduces expenditures on servicing, transmission, and distribution of electric energy, it reduces losses of it by 2-4 percent, it increases the handling capacity by 15-40 percent, and it significantly reduces the impact on the environment.   Among the opponents of the USVL are specialists--true, not many of them--who simply cannot understand that the future lies with these lines. That is, because of certain considerations they do not want to understand. I am prepared to discuss all issues with them under the condition that they not be guided by a desire to prove that they are right by any means but exclusively by the interests of the matter.   [Valentik] Apparently the World Bank will grant Moldova credit in the amount of $30 million for the development of energy engineering with a rate of 7.5 percent. How, in your view, should this money be used?   [Postolatiy] For transportation for the delivery of fuel and for storage facilities. This will be recouped 100-fold. For increasing the effectiveness of the processing and utilization of fuel. To do this it is necessary to update and reconstruct equipment. For reinforcement of energy ties with our neighbors, that is, the construction of high-voltage power transmission lines that link us to energy systems of Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, etc. For reinforcement of connections among energy systems inside the republic.   Russia is proposing a joint project for the assimilation of the Yamal gas deposit and the deposits of Western Siberia. I think that it is simply necessary for Moldova to participate in them. Along with this it is necessary to study the possibility of obtaining fuel resources from other countries.   [Valentik] We shall hope that we will not spread out the American credit among the various ministries and departments and...well, I wish success to your institute and to you, its leader.

Three Foreign Investment Projects Approved    Pacific Rim Economic Review FBPSP 94-02)    JAPAN:  Economic Trends -- FEATURE:  Report Assesses Consumer Impact of Government Regulations -- SUMMARY:  According to a report written by the Daiwa Research Institute (DRI), prices in Japan for public utilities, transportation, food, and gasoline--all industries protected by government regulations--are much higher than prices in the United States, while the prices of automobiles and electrical machinery--industries which are not regulated--are roughly comparable or lower.  The report urges deregulation to eliminate price differences and to realize Japan's full growth potential. Also, in an article published on 24 December, Seiji Shimpo, a Ministry of Finance (MOF) economist, urges deregulation so that Japan can harmonize its economy with the world economy if it is to survive.    To analyze the difference between Japanese and U.S. consumer prices, the DRI surveyed the prices of 23 items in various industrial categories in both countries between August and November 1993, according to a DRI report published in the 18 December issue of SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI, a leading business weekly.  At an exchange rate of 107 yen to the dollar, Japanese prices are from 1.1 to 2.0 times higher than U.S. prices.  Even using the 1992 OECD purchasing power rate of 190 yen to the dollar, Japanese prices are 0.6 to 1.5 times higher than U.S  prices.    Based on the survey, the DRI calculated parity exchange rates for each of the 23 items.  They range from 1,180 yen to $1 for wheat, 700 yen per $1 for gasoline, 540 yen for butter, 290 yen for long-distance telephone calls and electricity, 135 yen for automobiles, 120 yen for audio-visual equipment, and 50 yen for pharmaceutical products sold to hospitals.    Big Price Disparities Due to Productivity Differences -- The DRI report points out that price differences among Japanese goods and services caused by differences in productivity are far greater than differences between foreign and domestic prices, which are mainly caused by a strong yen that does not reflect actual purchasing power.  Those items whose Japanese prices are higher than U.S. prices, based on either the current yen to dollar rate (107:1) or the OECD's 190:1 rate, or the purchasing power rate are foodstuffs, petroleum products, public utilities, housing, apparel, and polyethylene, products which are for the most part are regulated by the government and whose productivity is low.    In the case of automobiles, audio-visual equipment, ethylene, steel, copper, high-quality paper, and oil tankers, whose production is not regulated by the government and which are manufactured in highly productive processes, Japanese prices are still slightly higher based on the current exchange rate, but would be lower based on a purchasing power rate.    According to the report, pharmaceutical products sold to hospitals are the only items whose prices are remarkably lower based on either the current or purchasing power rate.  The report notes, however, that since Japanese doctors and hospitals tend to prescribe excessive quantities of drugs, consumers end up paying much money for drugs.    Prices Remain High Even Though Yen Has Appreciated -- Concerning manufactured and processed goods other than dairy products, textiles, color television sets, and semiconductors, domestic prices have not come down even though the yen started appreciating in 1985. The primary reason, according to the DRI report, is that Japanese imports have not increased sufficiently to cause domestic prices to drop.  The report explains that government regulations, standards and certification systems, and a variety of Japanese business practices work to prevent foreign products, whose prices have dropped due to the strong yen, from gaining market share in Japan. The report argues that because of such barriers, the commonly understood logic that yen appreciation will lead to increased imports, which in turn will promote competition in the Japanese market, increase Japanese productivity, and lower prices, does not work in Japan.    Concerning services, such as public utilities, distribution, and personal services, the report adds that Japanese prices have remained basically the same regardless of the exchange rate, because the exchange rate does not affect competitive conditions in these industries.    Deregulation Urged To Realize Full Growth Potential -- The report urges deregulation measures be adopted by the government to raise productivity in protected industries and eliminate price differences.  The report claims that the automobile and electronics industries, which have led Japan's exports and contributed to its economic growth, are not regulated and therefore have achieved high productivity and international competitiveness in the face of severe competition.  In the public utilities, communications, food, and petroleum industries, on the other hand, protection by government regulations has kept both productivity and competitiveness low.    The DRI concludes that when the government deregulates the protected industries to raise their productivity to U.S. levels, Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) would be 10 percent, or 45 trillion yen ($421 billion), higher than if no deregulation occurs in the next 10 years.  It also notes that when productivity is raised by deregulation, approximately 6.4 million workers, or about 10 percent of the total labor force, will become surplus.    MOF Economist Urges Deregulation To Help Japan's Economic Recovery -- In an article published in the 24 December NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN (NIKKEI), Seiji Shimpo, deputy director of Ministry of Finance's (MOF) Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, argues that Japan should implement deregulation for two basic reasons: 1) Japan's system must be compatible with those of other industrialized countries; and 2) Japan needs to expand opportunities for new businesses to escape the current recession.  Shimpo notes that contrary to the international trend toward deregulation following the collapse of the planned economies, the number of regulations has been increasing in Japan.  In 1987, for example, 40.1 percent of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) was produced by industries that are regulated to some extent, and 21.8 percent of GDP was produced by industries that are tightly regulated.  In 1989, these percentages increased to 40.8 percent and 24.1 percent respectively.    In addition to intense lobbying by interest groups, Shimpo points out that the value Japanese place on coexistence and harmony is an obstacle to deregulation.  Shimpo rejects the Federation of Economic Organizations' (Keidanren) policy of coexistence (kyosei) by asking why consumers want inefficient firms and incompetent managers to coexist.  Shimpo notes that the government, Keidanren, and even the media have a perception that government guidance and the observance of guidance by industry are ethical.  In the same vein, order and mutual assistance among companies in an industry are virtues.  Shimpo asserts that all this contradicts the principle of competition upon which market capitalism is founded. The Japanese people should remember, he observes, that the basic factor generating economic development in Japan has been market competition, not government regulation.    Shimpo is critical of Japan's media for tending to report economic issues in a manner that appeals to the heart rather than the mind of readers.  This helps the so-called revisionists in the United States justify their calls for discrimination against Japan in international trade by highlighting alleged differences between Japan and the other industrialized nations.  Shimpo asserts that it is Japan's responsibility to prove that the revisionists are wrong by reforming Japan's economic society.    In conclusion, Shimpo restates his view that deregulation is an unavoidable step in harmonizing the Japanese economy with the world economy, from which Japan cannot be isolated if it is to survive. He urges politicians to institutionalize the economic logic and analyses of deregulation that have been recommended by economists.    MOF Makes It Easier for Consumers To Monitor Prices of Imported Goods -- As part of the Hosokawa cabinet's policy of sharing the benefits of the current strong yen with consumers, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) published in the November issue of FINANCE, the ministry's monthly journal, a report on the custom clearance prices of 30 consumer products imported in September 1993.  The MOF selected 30 consumer goods which it considers of the highest interest to consumers and, for the first time, published their prices separately from the detailed custom clearance data appearing in its monthly trade statistics.    According to the report, the import prices for 25 of the 30 products dropped compared to September 1992, ranging from a 43- percent drop in the price of bananas, a 38.7-percent decline in the price of Italian dress shirts, a 5.6-percent drop for U.S. cigarettes, and a 4.5-percent drop for Scotch whisky.  The weighted average of the 30 custom clearance prices dropped 14.8 percent compared to September 1992.  The report concludes that the primary cause for the drop in import prices is the appreciation of the yen, which has appreciated by 16.1 percent, from 124 yen per dollar in September 1992 to 104 in September 1993.  The report notes that some of the goods were paid for in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For example, English tea was priced in British pounds, which depreciated about 30 percent against the yen, and Italian dress shirts were priced in Italian lira, which depreciated about 42 percent against the yen.  Some goods were contracted for in yen, such as frozen tuna, American beer and cigarettes, and German automobiles, and their import prices were not affected by the foreign exchange rate.    The MOF report also contains Tokyo retail prices compiled by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) as of October 1993 for 20 of the 30 imported consumer goods.  The MOF claims that by comparing retail prices continuously, everyone will see the extent to which the benefits of a strong yen are distributed.  The MOF urges consumers to strictly monitor trends in import and retail prices.    According to the EPA data contained in the MOF report, the Tokyo retail prices of the 20 imported products rarely reflect the decreases in import prices.  For example, the custom clearance price of Italian spaghetti dropped 35.7 percent, while the retail price dropped only 4.1 percent, and the custom clearance price of U.S. golf balls dropped 10.3 percent, but the retail price rose 1.0 percent.  Of 16 imported consumer goods whose custom clearance prices had fallen, the retail prices of 13 goods dropped; two (U.S. beer and U.S. cigarettes) remained the same; and one (U.S. golf balls) rose.  Of the four products whose custom clearance prices had risen, the retail prices of two (oranges and tennis rackets) dropped, while two (EC-made electric shavers and lemons) rose.    Environmental Issues:  STA To Begin Underwater Cable Project To Track Seismic Activity -- The Science and Technology Agency (STA) this year will begin a 10-year project to lay an underwater fiber optic cable, fitted with seismometers, around the Japanese archipelago as part of a comprehensive marine environmental observation network to track and monitor undersea seismic activity. Basically the STA will use the fiber optic network in place of observation vessels and submarines to detect earthquakes and tidal waves and to provide timely, detailed information on their scale and potential impact.  The STA also hopes to attach other sensors to the fiber optic cable to measure underwater temperatures, ocean currents, and earth plate and volcanic activity, as well as to collect data on the levels of carbon dioxide in sea water for research on global warming.  The research results gained from the project will also be used to develop technology for using the optical fiber itself as a type of thermometer.    Twenty public and private enterprises will participate in the STA project, including research organizations of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Transport, Tokyo University, NEC, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Oki Electric Industry.  The STA will spend the first five years of the project developing the basic technology related to the seismometers and developing methods to transmit the data.  Then the agency will begin laying the fiber optic cable off the Japanese islands and later at deeper levels, closer to submarine trenches.  (Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 4 Jan 94 p 1)    KEPCO, TEPCO To Provide Environmental Know-how To India -- Kansai Electric Power Co. (KEPCO) and Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) will provide environmental technology and know-how to the nine thermal power plants in India with a total generating capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts. The two companies will work with the public thermal power companies which manage the plants as part of an agreement reached at a 1992 meeting of power company executives from throughout the world.    KEPCO will transfer its environmental technology and plant management know-how to control sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.  TEPCO will provide guidance on improving the fuel efficiency of boilers to reduce the amount of coal consumed, and also will instruct the companies on reducing and controlling the volume of gas emissions from their thermal power plants.  (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 4 Jan 94 p 11)    Financial Issues:  FEATURE:  Japanese Banks Have 'Asia Fever' -- SUMMARY:  According to the Japanese press, Japanese banks are making a special effort to penetrate financial markets in Thailand, Malaysia, and China.    The 7 December MAINICHI SHIMBUN reports that presently there are 18 Japanese banks in Thailand, including six that opened branches in Bangkok in 1993--Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB), Sumitomo Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), and Sanwa Bank--and two that established representative offices there in 1993, Bank of Fukuoka and Sumitomo Trust Bank.  The banks are reportedly responding to the Thai government's financial liberalization policy and promotion of offshore markets.  According to one Japanese branch manager in Thailand, the rate of profit at Thai branches is first or second among our branches worldwide.  The banks say that their objective in going into Thailand is to supply Japanese companies with funds to expand their operations there.    Meanwhile in Malaysia, according to the MAINICHI, Japanese banks are participating in creating an international financial center (kokusai kinyu center) on Labuan Island, an offshore market located in the north of Borneo.  DKB and Sanwa opened branches there in November 1993 while IBJ and Sakura were scheduled to follow suit in December.    In addition, the 17 January NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN reports that the Singapore branches of DKB, Sumitomo, Tokai Bank, and IBJ have formally agreed to provide $250 million to the Malaysia Highway Authority (Malaysia Kosokudorocho) in cooperation with two Malaysian commercial banks.  The loan will be registered in an account in the Labuan market.  The Malaysian government has been promoting the Labuan market for the past few years, but by year-end 1992 its outstanding transaction balance was only $1 billion. The recent loan by the Japanese banks is the largest since they began entering that market in the spring of 1993.  Malaysia expects the Japanese banks to be the driving force behind the growth of the Labuan market.    Banks Financing Hong Kong Real Estate Development -- Major commercial and long-term credit banks are stepping up real-estate- related financing in Hong Kong, according to the 3 January NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN (NIKKEI).  In September 1993, the Bank of Tokyo, Fuji, Sanwa, Sumitomo and LTCB syndicated a loan amounting to HK$2.65 billion (roughly $343.3 million) to Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., a large Hong Kong real estate developer.  In addition, Mitsubishi Bank and Sumitomo, among others,  provided funding to Sun Hung Kai Properties, another major real estate developer, when it raised HK$900 million (roughly $116.8 million) to renovate office buildings.    According to NIKKEI, in Hong Kong, which is considered the gateway to investment in China, the demand for office buildings and housing continues to grow while prices continue to rise.  Hong Kong's large corporations rely largely on Japanese banks for financing in the competitive real-estate development market.    MOF Appeals to Chinese Government on Behalf of Japanese Banks -- The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is reportedly asking the Chinese government to allow Japanese banks to deal in the Chinese yuan. According to the 15 January NIKKEI, currently, it does not allow foreign banks to deal in yuan. Thus, Japanese banks can only make loans and conduct foreign exchange in dollars or yen, while Japanese companies in China, as a result of a revision in the foreign exchange system on 1 January, are prohibited from holding or using anything but the yuan.  Consequently, Japanese banks cannot satisfy the need of Japanese companies for interim operational funds.    NIKKEI reports, by the end of 1993, 10 Japanese banks had opened 17 branches and 54 representative offices in China in response to the government's reform and liberalization policy begun in the late l97Os.  But foreign banks are concerned that the recent revision of China's foreign exchange system will be a major hindrance to their business there.  Upon appeals from the banks, MOP has unofficially started working on getting authorization from the Chinese government for the banks to deal in yuan. MOF's goal is not only to promote penetration by Japanese banks into the Chinese market but also indirectly to assist Japanese companies to invest there.    FEATURE:  Housing Lenders' Delinquencies Threaten Financial System -- SUMMARY:  Japan's housing loan corporations continue to pose a major threat to the stability of the financial system, according to press reports. Although virtually all of these corporations implemented restructuring plans in the spring of 1993, because of the sluggish real estate market and the erosion of their traditional lending market by other banks and the government-run Housing Loan Corporation (HLC), the housing lenders are reportedly straining the major financial institutions that founded them.

FBIS3-42381	{"document_id": "FBIS3-42381","text": "After the completion of the Apollo moon program at the beginning of the 1970s, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Defense launched the design engineering of the Space Shuttle reusable space transport system (MTKS). The decision was made in the USSR to create a transport system for analogous purposes in order to preserve parity, although the conceptual framework for air/space craft had begun to be developed here before the Americans -- since the beginning of the 1960s. <H6>  Space Shuttle </H6>  Crew. Two astronautpilots and up to five flight specialists.   Composition. The Space Shuttle MTKS has an orbital aircraft (OS), an external fuel tank (VTB) and two solid-fuel launch boosters (STU), sometimes called the first stage. The sole non-reusable element of the system is the VTB.   Flight configuration. The three propulsion ZhRDs [liquid-fuel rocket engines] of the OS and STU are ignited from the moment of launch. The MTKS is launched vertically. The spent STUs separate from the VTB and drop into the Atlantic Ocean by parachute. The OS continues flight using its own propulsion ZhRDs, and after the fuel in the VTB is expended the tank separates from the OS and burns up in the atmosphere. The aircraft is brought into orbit using the ZhRD of the orbital maneuvering system (SOM), which operates using storable hypergolic fuel. The MTKS is controlled on the injection section by rolling the propulsion ZhRDs in swivel suspensions and deflecting the STU nozzles in an elastomeric (flexible) bearing. The OS is controlled in orbit by the ZhRDs of the low-thrust rocket control system (RSU), which operates, like the SOM engines, using storable hypergolic fuel and is installed in the nose and in two rear sections. The OS, upon completion of orbital operations, is slowed by the SOM engines, enters the atmosphere and makes an aerodynamic controlled descent, a glide and a horizontal landing with inoperative engines. The RSU are used when leaving orbit and flying in the upper layers of the atmosphere, and the aerodynamic control surfaces enter into operation to the extent of the descent of the OS. The crew pilots the OS on the glide and landing legs.   Design. The wing is a low-mounted delta wing with dual sweep on the leading edge, split ailerons on the trailing edge and without any means of mechanization. The fuselage is a semimonocoque design with flat sides. It consists of three parts--the nose holds a two-level airtight cockpit for the crew and a compartment for the electronics gear, the middle has a non-airtight cargo bay (OPN), under which runs the central torsion box of the wing, and in the rear is the compartment for the main engine installation (ODU), the SOM nacelles and the swept tail with a split rudder. The lower portion of the rear tail section has a balancing flap under the fuselage, which plays the role of an air brake along with the rudder during landing. The airframe was constructed principally of aluminum alloys. The doors of the OPN and the fairing of the SOM nacelles are manufactured of graphite-epoxy composite materials (KM); the strength elements of the tail fin are made of boron-aluminum KM, and the seating frame for the main ZhRDs of boron- epoxy KM; the housing of the high-pressure tanks and some of the trunk lines are made of Kevlar-epoxy resin type organic fibers.   Thermal protection of OS is passive, and covers almost the entire surface of the craft. The most heat-stressed locations on the OS--the tips of the fuselage and the wing--are covered with reinforced carbon-carbon type KM, followed by plates of silicon dioxide with a boron-silicate coating with heat-resistant additives that are black in color protecting the lower surfaces of the fuselage and the wing, as well as its tips and trailing edge. White plates of silicon dioxide fibers with a boron-silicate coating are installed on the upper surfaces of the wing and fuselage, the tail fin and the SOM nacelles. The least heat-stressed locations--the OPN doors, upper surface of the wing and sides of the fuselage and SOM nacelles--are protected with mats of nylon fiber covered with an organic silicon resin.   Engine installations. The main engine installation consists of three SSME oxygen-hydrogen propulsion ZhRDs from the firm of Rocketdyne, with a thrust of 170 tones of force each on Earth or 213 tons in a vacuum. The engines have a self-contained configuration (both components enter the combustion chamber in gaseous form), with the reheating of spent turbogas in high-pressure combustion chambers, installed on the OS and fed from the VTB. The two solid-fuel launch boosters from the firm of Morton-Thiokol mounted along the sides of the VTB have a thrust of 1,203 tons of force at sea level.   The power plant of the OS consists of three batteries of hydrogen-oxygen fuel elements and three hydrazine auxiliary power plants used to steer the main ZhRDs, as well as to control the aerodynamic surfaces and the landing gear.   Status. The Space Shuttle MTKS had made 53 flights as of January 1993. Six OS were built--the Enterprise (employed as an analogue of the OS for horizontal flight testing), the Columbia, the Challenger (lost in the catastrophe of January 1986), the Atlantis, the Discovery and the Endeavour. The system continues to be in service.   Additional information. The existing configuration of the MTKS was chosen in 1974. The flight testing started in April of 1981.   The MTKS is currently employed for deliveries to space, supporting astronauts in orbit and returning especially valuable payloads to Earth, but the Department of Defense had decided by the end of 1992 to refrain from the use of the MTKS to put military payloads into orbit, and to use the non-reusable launch vehicles of the Titan family for this purpose. <H6>  Energiya/Buran </H6>  Crew. Two to four cosmonaut/pilots and up to six flight specialists.   Composition. The Energiya/Buran MTKS includes the Energiya launch vehicle (four Zenit-1 launch boosters and a central second-stage unit), which is able to put various payloads and the Buran orbital vessel (OK) into orbit. The OK and the launch boosters are the reusable elements of the system.   Flight configuration. At the moment of launch the MTKS includes the four RD-0120 oxygen-hydrogen engines of the central unit and the four RD-170 oxygen-kerosene engines of the boosters. Launch is vertical. The boosters separate from the central unit after finishing their operation, make a parachute descent in the atmosphere and land. The central unit ceases operation before reaching the nominal orbit, separates from the OK and is destroyed on entering the dense layers of the atmosphere. The OK is brought up to orbit using two oxygen-kerosene ZhRDs of the SOM system. The MTKS is controlled during this ascent stage by steering the combustion chambers of the ZhRDs in the central unit and the boosters on their bearing suspensions. Low-thrust oxygen- kerosene ZhRDs mounted in the nose and two in the rear RSU units control the OK in orbit. After the completion of orbital operations, the SOM engine issues a braking impulse, and the OK enters the atmosphere, makes an aerodynamic controlled descent, glides and make a horizontal landing with non-operating engines. The RSUs are used when leaving orbit and in the upper layers of the atmosphere, with the aerodynamic control surfaces coming into action to the extent of the descent of the OK. The OK can be controlled on the glide and landing legs either by the crew or automatically.   Design of the OK. The Buran is in principle analogous to the OS of the Space Shuttle by and large, but its wing is shifted forward somewhat. The tail section of the fuselage, aside from the rudder and flap under the fuselage, has the SOM engine installation, RSU units and a pod with the braking parachute.   Thermal protection of the OK is passive and plated. The tips of the fuselage and wing are covered with a carbon-carbon type reinforced KM, with the less heat-stressed places having plates of sintered quartz fiber with a protective coating. The thermal protection of the Buran OK, as opposed to the American craft, is all-weather--it can withstand rain and hail.   Engine installations. The principal ZhRDs of the launch vehicle and the ship are executed in a self-contained configuration (hydrogen comes into the combustion chamber in gaseous form, and the oxygen in liquid form) with the reheating of spent turbogas in the combustion chambers under high pressure. The RD-170 engines have a thrust of 740 tonnes of force each, the RD-0120s 156 tonnes each (205 in a vacuum) and the SOM ZhRDs 8,500 tonnes in a vacuum.   The power plant of the Buran OK is analogous to that of the Space Shuttle OS.   Status. The Energiya launch vehicle has made two flights--15 May 1987 with a Skif-DM (Polyus) module as the payload, and 15 November 1988 with the Buran OK without cosmonauts. The OK No. 1 had been mothballed by the start of 1993, with the OK No. 2 prepared for orbital flight; the manufacture of OK No. 3 has been curtailed.   Additional information. The decree on the development of the Energiya/Buran MTKS came out in February 1976 after the cancellation of the N1-L3 program. The manufacture of five Buran OKs had been proposed. The MTKS was to meet the country's needs for the placement into orbit of medium and heavy payloads for civilian and military purposes, with the return of some of them to Earth.   A special version of the VM-T bomber, which provided for the separate transport of the launch vehicle and the OK on an external hanger over the aircraft fuselage, was created in order to transport the larger elements of the system from the manufacturing plant to the engineering positions. The An-225 Mriya heavy-lift transport aircraft was later created for these same purposes.   Smaller models of the OK (the BOR-4 and BOR-5) launched using the Kosmos launch vehicle were used to try out the aerodynamics and thermal protection of the craft in the range of high hypersonic speeds.   Flight testing of the Energiya/Buran has been halted, owing to the cutbacks in appropriations and the loss of interest in the program on the part of the Ministry of Defense. A non-piloted flight of Buran OK No. 2 is being proposed for 1993, with the subsequent mothballing of all of the MTKSs until such time as spheres for its efficient utilization are found.
