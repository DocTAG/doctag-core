FBIS3-10551,"eliable Foreign Ministry sources told CLARIN \nyesterday that, during May, Argentina and Great Britain will \nresume negotiations on the possibility of some form of \ncooperation for oil exploration and exploitation in the Malvinas \nIsland coastal waters. The Kelpers are scheduled to begin the \nprocess at the end of the year, with or without Argentina's \napproval. \n  The date for reopening the negotiations (which have been \nfrozen since 1992) was agreed between Foreign Minister Guido Di \nTella and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd during a meeting \nin London on 3 March. Negotiations will be carried out within \nthe so-called Argentine-British High-Level Group which has been \ninactive since negotiations failed in 1992. \n  Di Tella was scheduled to make a private visit to London \nthis \ncoming weekend, but he brought the date forward to 10 March \ndespite the fact that President Carlos Menem was still in Spain. \nHis haste to meet with Hurd was reportedly due to the fact that \nthe meeting was going to take place before this month, but he \nstill did not have British approval, which was only granted on 3 \nMarch. \n  Di Tella and Hurd also agreed to negotiate through \ndiplomatic \nchannels during the time remaining before the meeting -- which \nmust be carried out in Buenos Aires -- in order to formulate a \nbasis for a prior agreement to guarantee some positive results \nat the key meeting. \n  One of the hurdles -- beside the conflict over sovereignty \nthat is being kept under the framework of the so-called \nprotective umbrella -- is to define the reaches of the term \ncooperation. \n  -- So far, although it is not a definitive answer, Great \nBritain understands that the term only supposes the exchange of \ninformation and the willingness to act jointly to protect the \nenvironment. \n  -- Argentina, however, thinks that the term supposes \nparticipation in oil exploration and exploitation within the \narea controlled by the British. \n  During the London meeting Di Tella mentioned a topic that is \nindirectly related to the Malvinas Islands. He mentioned to \nHurd Argentina's concern over Great Britain's increasing \npolitical and military relations with Chile. \n  The Argentine foreign minister mentioned the one-week visit \nfuture Chilean Defense Minister Perez Yoma is scheduled to make \nto London and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's \nvisit to Chile, among other things. \n  Hurd's answer was that Perez Yoma was invited before he was \nnamed minister and that Thatcher is no longer a member of the \nBritish Government. \n  Hurd affirmed that London does not want to drive any wedge \nbetween Argentina and Chile; on the contrary, it is interested \nin good relations between the two Latin American countries. \n  The Chilean question was only a side issue of the meeting's \ncentral topic: Oil. Di Tella knows that the issue will be \nessential for the success or failure of his Malvinas policy. \n  The Kelpers are ready to call for bids on the licenses to \nbegin exploring and exploiting for oil by the end of the year, \nif negotiations in May fail. \n  This is why leading Foreign Ministry officials are thinking \nof discussing the issue with U.S. Vice President Al Gore when he \nvisits Buenos Aires at the end of the month, as CLARIN announced \non 2 March. \n  What diplomats seem not to have been taken into account is \nthat Gore supports ecologist concepts which oppose all \noff-shore drilling, due to their negative effects on the \nenvironment. In any case, to play the North American game now \nseems premature, unless you believe that the May negotiation \nwill not succeed due to the distance separating the two parties. "
FBIS3-10646,"Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella told LA NACION on 4 \nMarch that after his meeting with Foreign Office head Douglas \nHurd in London on 3 March, he is absolutely convinced that \nGreat Britain sees Argentine-Chilean relations with good eyes. \n  In a telephone call from the United Kingdom, the minister \nanalyzed the meeting and commented on an article about it, which \nwas published on 4 March. Di Tella said the British Government \nsupports rapprochement between the two countries. He added \nthat if relations with Chile were good during President Aylwin's \nadministration they will be very good during the Frei \nadministration, and will have still more impetus. \n  It is hard to understand Di Tella's ideas, particularly the \nemphasis given to British support of ties between Argentina and \nChile, if facts kept in absolute secrecy until 4 March are \nignored. These facts caused surprise and uneasiness among \nofficial circles. \n  The reason behind it was a donation. \n  Argentina had to conduct diplomatic actions to clarify a \nBritish donation to the Chilean Air Museum. \n  The donation consists of a Harrier plane that still shows \nwhere it was hit by Argentine bullets. The plane participated \nin the Malvinas War. The donation will be officially made on 22 \nMarch, presided over by former iron lady Margaret Thatcher, who \nwill visit Santiago from 20 to 23 March. \n  Some Argentine representatives of the media believe there is \nthe clear intention of affecting the good relations being \nenjoyed by the two countries, seeking to revert to the times \nwhen the theory of balanced forces -- sponsored by the large \nproducing centers -- was fervently complied with in Latin \nAmerica. \n  As LA NACION reported, Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando \nPetrella traveled to Chile practically the same day Di Tella \nleft for London. Chilean civilian officials who will soon be \ninstalled allegedly knew nothing about the issue. \n  Although Hurd's answer about the donation has not been made \npublic, the Argentine foreign minister said he had received \nfull explanations about the discussed issues. \n  In Di Tella's opinion, following the almost 80-minute \nprivate \nmeeting with his British counterpart on 3 March, the objective \nof Thatcher's presence in Santiago are merely to sell her book \nand give a paid lecture. \n  Di Tella pragmatically said: The possibility of receiving a \nfew dollars for a book should not be disdained. \n  Di Tella said Hurd's upcoming visit to the Malvinas Islands \nhas only a relative political importance. \n  The minister said his British counterpart mentioned to him \nthat he has not visited the islands during the five years he has \nbeen in the government. \n  His visit, however, could be interpreted as a sort of \npolitical homage to the islanders, perhaps under pressure from \nthe Conservative Party's hard wing. He will be in Malvinas the \nday marking the 12th anniversary of the arrival of Argentine \nforces on the islands on 2 April 1982. \n  During the telephone conversation, Di Tella gave the \nimpression that Hurd could explain to the islanders the \nsecurities offered that Great Britain is clearly seeking ways \nto cooperate over oil exploration...if that is possible. \n"
FBIS3-19947,"Paris, March 24 (AFP) -- Britain and Argentina \nclashed over the disputed Falkland Islands in a parliamentary \nforum here Thursday [24 March], with the Argentinian Senate \nleader calling on Britain to resume negotiations on sovereignty. \n  This claim aims at putting an end to the anachronistic \ncolonial situation upheld by Great Britain on a portion of \nArgentinian territory, in an open violation of the fundamental \nprinciples of international law, Eduardo Menem told the \nInterparliamentary Union [IPU]. \n  The unilateral decisions made by the United Kingdom as \nregards oil in the Malvinas Islands (the Argentinian name for \nthe disputed islands) and the extension of its alleged \njurisdiction around South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, \nprove the British lack of disposition to start effective \nnegotiations with Argentina, said Menem, brother of Argentinian \nPresident Carlos Menem. \n  But Lord David Montgomery criticised Menem for raising the \nissue, saying bilateral mechanisms are already in place to \ncontinue discussions on all subjects. Mr Menem's statement \nseems to ignore the rights of the Falkland Islanders in the \nmatter of self-determination, he added. \n  The two countries fought a brief war over the islands in \n1992. "
FBIS3-11107,"Seven words uttered by British Foreign Minister \nDouglas Hurd produced a smile on the face of his Argentine \ncounterpart, Guido Di Tella. Hurd said: We could possibly \nagree on broad cooperation on the oil exploration the Kelpers \nwant to initiate by the end of the year in the waters \nsurrounding the Malvinas Islands. British sources told CLARIN on \n12 March that Hurd made this remark to Di Tella during a meeting \nlast week in London. \n  As CLARIN already announced, this definition will be the new \nbasis for the position the British will champion late this month \nor in early April when negotiations attempting to achieve some \nform of cooperation on the oil issue will be resumed. \nNegotiations have been suspended since late 1992, when the \nUnited Kingdom unilaterally decided to initiate seismic \nprospecting work in the sea bed surrounding the Malvinas Islands \ndespite Argentine protests. \n  Initially, Hurd talked about cooperation alone, which \nideally \nrepresented exchanging information. British sources announced \nthat, in diplomatic parlance, however, this new definition means \nthat London is willing to accept the participation of Argentine \ncompanies in the exploration effort and the replenishment and \nrepair of oil platforms in Argentine ports. A similar message \nwas conveyed by the British ambassador in Buenos Aires, Peter \nHall, to Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella during a \nmeeting they held on 7 March to discuss the crisis in Yugoslavia. \n  Nevertheless, this is not the final British position. Hurd \nwill travel on 9 April to the Malvinas Islands for consultations \nwith the islanders -- who refuse to restore communications with \nArgentina -- before initiating negotiations with Buenos Aires. \nThe Malvinas Islands' residents only are willing to cooperate \nwith Argentina if necessary and are moving ahead -- full steam \n-- with their preparations: They already have received a Royal \nGeological Service report recommending where to drill in order \nto determine the existence of oil and establishing the required \nlegal or tax framework. \n  Incidentally, this is one of the most difficult points for \nnegotiations that demonstrates that both oil and fishing are \nclosely linked to the sovereignty conflict. Argentina wants to \ncollect part of the taxes that will be charged to the oil \ncompanies, but the United Kingdom rejects this possibility, even \nthough it is not yet known with complete certainty if there is \noil. \n  Florencio Acenolaza, the Chamber of Deputies Foreign \nRelations Committee chairman and a geologist by profession, \nrecently noted in a communique that there is no oil in the \nMalvinas Islands' submarine shelf. \n  YPF [Government Oil Deposits] President Jose Estenssoro \nquickly went to the Foreign Ministry to make it clear that \nAcenolaza based himself on outdated information and that YPF \nis studying one of the two seismic surveys carried out in the \nMalvinas Islands last year. Official sources confirmed to \nCLARIN that the survey was purchased through a YPF subsidiary. \nThe report is confidential because it is a commercial secret. \n  Nevertheless, the existence of hydrocarbons will not be \nproven until the sea bed is drilled, despite the positive \nseismic reports. The basins may be empty, with more gas than oil \nor with little oil, which would make the business unprofitable. \n"
FBIS3-10697,"London -- Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella's \ninnocent three-day trip to England to visit his son Rafael has \nyielded other results. He discovered that John Major's \nadministration considers the issue of negotiations with the \nMenem administration on the issue of oil around the Malvinas \nIsland convenient but not indispensable and that the United \nKingdom is ready to lift the arms embargo imposed on Argentina \nsince the Malvinas war. \n  CLARIN talked with Di Tella, who was staying at the \nArgentine \nEmbassy residence in Paris and will arrive back in Buenos Aires \nthis morning. \n  [CLARIN] What are the results of your meeting with Foreign \nand Commonwealth Affairs Secretary Douglas Hurd? \n  [Di Tella] I had a long meeting with him and ended up \nclarifying two important issues: negotiations on oil \nexploration, which will have a busy agenda, and the issue of \nrelations with Chile. It was established that we will cooperate. \nThey consider British-Argentine negotiations convenient but not \nindispensable, and we consider them indispensable. The two \ncountries have agreed that it is convenient. \n  [CLARIN] Has Hurd offered you seismic prospecting results or \ntold you how much oil there is in the islands? \n  [Di Tella] They have not been very explicit and they have \nnot \ngiven me any seismic prospecting work. They assured us that they \nare still not sure how much oil there is in the area. \n  [CLARIN] Did he reproach you for Argentina's theft of the \nseismic prospecting carried out on orders of the island's \ngovernment through an Argentine ghost company? \n  [Di Tella] They did not complain. On the other hand, it was \nnot a ghost company but a YPF [Government Oil Deposits] \nsubsidiary. I cannot recall the name of the company now. \n  [CLARIN] Did you establish an agenda to discuss the oil \nsituation? \n  [Di Tella] There is a verbal agreement. But never before \nwas the convenience of negotiating the issue of oil \nexploration mentioned so explicitly. A technical team will meet \nin April to discuss these questions. \n  [CLARIN] Great Britain's problem is that insurance companies \nrefuse to insure off shore [preceding two words in English] \nexplorations in conflict zones such as the area around the \nMalvinas Islands. In the back of their minds they have the ghost \nof what happened with Kuwait's oil wells, which were set on fire \nby the Iraqis. How will Argentina take advantage of this \nsituation in negotiations for the Malvinas Islands? \n  [Di Tella] Argentina can create serious juridical problems \nfor Great Britain in the South Atlantic. We are going to do just \nthat. The British Government is at a point where it must discuss \nthe issue of oil exploration with us. Our warning notes on the \nmatter have worried companies in the area. \n  [CLARIN] Are you using that as a future threat? \n  [Di Tella] It is not a threat. That is life...If you push a \ndoor bell you will hear a noise...I will take every legal step \npossible to achieve our objective. \n  [CLARIN] Did you discuss the Argentine Government's \napprehensions about British interference in Argentine-Chilean \nrelations? \n  [Di Tella] That was one of the main reasons for my trip and \nmy interest in seeing Hurd. It was one of the topics on our \nagenda. I talked to him about the excellent status of \nArgentine-Chilean relations and the need we have for Great \nBritain to help consolidate it. \n  [CLARIN] What did Hurd say about Margaret Thatcher's visit \nto \nChile in the next few days? \n  [Di Tella] Hurd told me that Mrs. Thatcher is going to Chile \nbecause she feels like it. Maggie has never (in English), \nand least of all now, accepted pressure from anyone. She is \npromoting her Memories and has made more than 3 million pounds \nfrom it. For her the monetary issue is very important. She \ncannot be pressured, least of all by John Major's government. \n  [CLARIN] Why will Hurd travel to Malvinas if \nBritish-Argentine relations are so good? \n  [Di Tella] Hurd simply told me: I have been in the post for \nfive years and never visited the islands. Besides you are very \nactive diplomatically and you visit us every three months. I \nam highly encouraged to see that my charming [preceding word in \nEnglish] operation is yielding these results. \n  [CLARIN] According to British sources, the Major government \nis ready to sell arms to Argentina. \n  [Di Tella] They can offer them. We do not have any problems. \nWe want an end to the arms embargo. In this visit to London I \nhad the impression that the arms embargo issue will soon be a \nthing of the past. \n"

FBIS3-10698,"London -- For the first time since the Malvinas War, \nthe chief of the government intelligence services, Hugo \nAnzorreguy, was received by his British counterparts during an \nofficial 36-hour visit to London. This courtesy will be \nreturned in Buenos Aires today, when David Spedding -- the \nnumber two man in the British MI6 service, and the future number \none by the end of 1994 -- will arrive here for a three-day stay. \n  As a result of this meeting it was decided that SIDE \n[Secretariat for State Intelligence] agents will be trained in \nintelligence analysis by British spies in the next few \nmonths. \n  During a rainy morning yesterday, and watched over by \ndiscreet bodyguards, Anzorreguy held a long conversation in \nimpeccable English with Colin McColl, chief of the domestic \nespionage service MI5 [title as received]. \n  More feminine, Stella Rimmington -- the first woman \ndirecting \nthe foreign secret service MI6 [title as received] -- invited \nhim on the same day to lunch at San Lorenzo restaurant, Lady \nDi's favorite restaurant in Knightsbridge, near Harrods. \nRimmington extended the invitation to Anzorreguy's wife, \nMargarita Moline O'Connor, who accompanied her husband on this \ntour of espionage and good manners through Spain, France, and \nLondon. \n  Anzorreguy's visit had previously been canceled due to the \nillness of President Carlos Menem. \n  With British coolness, Colin McColl told Anzorreguy -- five \nminutes after beginning the conversation -- that the British \nintelligence services are very discreet: They do not grant \ninterviews, or allow photographs, or let any information be \nleaked. In subliminal language he meant to say that the \nconversation should be kept strictly off the record. \n  Anzorreguy was appalled with the MI5 chief's knowledge of \nthe \nArgentine dirty war; he knew so much that it was as if he had \nabsorbed the minds of an Argentine military officer and a \nguerrilla member. \n  The subject of terrorism monopolized the conversation, \ntogether with the problem of immigration as a possible source of \nconflict. \n  For McColl, the problems are the Pakistanis, Indians, and \nresidents of the former British colonies in the Caribbean. \nAnzorreguy told him that their equivalent, for Argentina, are \nthe Paraguayans, Bolivians, Chileans, and Peruvians who want to \ncome to Argentina dazed by the economic miracle. \n  When a year ago Anzorreguy visited the chief of the Russian \nsecret services in Moscow, the Russian chief's first question \nwas very direct. Tell me what Galtieri was like, the Soviet \nspy asked with curiosity, in referring to the Argentine general \nwho commanded the Malvinas War. Anzorreguy swallowed his \nfeelings, remembered the description of majestic general used \nby an aide to (former U.S. President) Reagan to describe the \nmastermind of the invasion of the islands, and answered: He \nwas a presumptuous general. \n  Stella Rimmington did not ask a single question about the \nMalvinas War, and much less about Galtieri's personality or \nabout the investigations into the soldiers executed in the \nMalvinas Islands. In her new and austere office with a view of \nthe River Thames, the MI6 chief aimed the conversation toward \nthe danger of nuclear proliferation without control and \nterrorism. \n  Rimmington walks daily from her house to her office without \nany guards; she has been photographed only once; she has no \ndomestic servant; and she is an expert Sovietologist. \n  During their conversation Anzorreguy stressed the excellent \ndiplomatic relations between Argentina and Chile. \n  When CLARIN asked Anzorreguy about the misunderstandings \nbetween Chile and Argentina that Argentine Foreign Ministry \nsources attributed to the British Government, Mr. Five [senor \ncinco] minimized these: These are pranks that we could play, \ntoo, he said. \n"
FBIS3-10889,"U.S. Vice President Al Gore will arrived in Brasilia \non 21 March. He will invite President Itamar Franco to the \nhemispheric summit that will meet in the next few months. \n  Gore's agenda also includes a debate with political leaders, \nentrepreneurs, and environmentalists, possibly with radio and \ntelevision coverage. \n  It is one form of doing politics based on the tradition of \nBritish colonizers who promoted debates with communities before \nmaking decisions. \n  The Clinton administration has started doing that, \ndomestically. Gore wants to do it in Brasilia. \n  The issue will be a single one during his meeting with \nItamar \nFranco, during the summit meeting or during the public debate: \nthe Americas' integration. \n  The issue has become vital to the United States' future \nleadership, in the Clinton government's view. \n  Jeffrey Garten, former banker and Wall Street broker and \ncurrent U.S. commerce under secretary for international trade, \nsummarized it this way: Our future capacity to compete, create \njobs, and remain world leaders will depend on our capacity to \nsucceed in the larger emerging markets. \n  For Washington there are three large emerging markets in \nLatin America: Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. \n  The candidates to succeed President Itamar Franco should \nbegin pondering this new U.S. diplomatic offensive in Latin \nAmerica that started with the signing of the free trade \nagreement with Mexico. \n  It is crucial for any political power project in the region. \nIt is the main condition for any government such as the \nBrazilian Government, which is betting on an autonomous \nforeign policy based on the full dominion of the Amazon basin \n(in the north) and the River Plate basin (in the south). \n  The Gore mission is an act that intends to prepare the \nLatin American political arena for the application of the new \nforeign relations model that Washington developed with Mexico \nand Canada during NAFTA's negotiations. \n  Gore's agenda during his 48 hours in Latin America is \neloquent: Before coming to Brasilia he will travel to Buenos \nAires. In Buenos Aires he is scheduled to give a strong speech \nat the World Telecommunications Conference -- the most coveted \nbusiness circle in the world. \n  He will speak about reinventing governments through a \nreduction of the state role in the economy. He should not repeat \nthe same speech in Brazil. The State Department is afraid of \nhurting the feelings of nationalists who might possibly identify \nGore's words with an interference in domestic affairs at a \nmoment Congress is trying to revise the Constitution. \n  In Buenos Aires, the U.S. vice president must confirm the \npossibility of closing with Argentina, possibly this year, the \nfirst protocols on free trade. \n  That strategy with Argentina, as the U.S. bureaucracy \ndefines it, will represent progress in the direction of a common \ncommercial promotion project (environmental technology and spare \nparts); the sale of capital goods, telecommunications equipment, \ntransportation, and basic sanitation with assured financing; \nassistance in the financial sector's deregulation; and \ntechnological cooperation in urban and environmental \nengineering and biotechnology. \n  It is a package in NAFTA's direction with the White \nHouse's \nstamp on it and the parallel support of multilateral agencies \nsuch as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. \n  Franco's successor will be installed on 1 January 1995. That \nday, the borders of the Common Market of the South [Mercosur] \nwill open up. \n  Mercosur, as well as NAFTA, are already part of the scenery. \nBoth projects have problems, but they might represent converging \nsolutions. \n  It will depend exclusively on the capacity of rulers to use \nthese projects as political instruments for introducing changes \nin this absurd picture of income distribution that is \nthreatening the future of democracy in Latin America. \n  The alternative is a political confrontation. \n"

In the \npast decade, the volume of industrial wastes released into the \natmosphere in conjunction with the rapid increase in industrial \ndevelopment has increased sharply and continues to increase. \nEach year, industrial enterprises, thermal electric power \nplants, motor vehicles, blast furnaces, aircraft engines, and \nother machines release hundreds of millions of tons of carbon in \nthe form of oxides, primarily carbon dioxide, into the \natmosphere. \n  The carbon dioxide released by humans and the animal world \nis \nabsorbed by plant life to provide a stable state of equilibrium \nin the atmosphere. Unfortunately, this equilibrium has now been \nupset, and the alarm of ecological catastrophe is sounding \nlouder with each passing year. The continuing increase in the \nconcentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an \nespecially negative phenomenon. Carbon dioxide is known to be \ntoxic in large quantities: It causes hypoxia and debilitated \nrespiration and cardiac activity. An increase in carbon dioxide \nconcentration not only has a direct effect on organisms but also \nfacilitates an increase in absorption of the earth's thermal \nradiation by the atmosphere, which in turn results in climate \nwarming throughout the entire planet. As is known, in the past \n100 years, the average temperature of the earth's surface \nincreased by 0.5-0.6ë, which has in turn accelerated glacial \nthawing and increased the sea's level by 1.5-2 m. \n  Also released along with carbon dioxide during the \ncombustion \nprocess is carbon monoxide, which has an even more toxic effect \nand which may result in debilitation of many vital functions, \nincluding illness of the central nervous system. \n  Metallurgy plants and thermal power plants release a large \namount of sulfur dioxide. Fossil fuels also contain a great deal \nof sulfur. Each year, about 30 million tons of sulfurous gas are \nreleased in our country. When sulfur dioxide reacts with \natmospheric moisture, sulfurous and sulfuric acids form. When \nnitrogen-containing coal and oil are burned, oxides are formed \nthat combine with atmospheric moisture to yield nitrous and \nnitric acids. These acids may cause serious lung diseases. \n  Ecological and sanitary and hygiene estimates are formulated \non the basis of data about emissions of pollutants into the \natmosphere. \n  In nature, everything is interconnected. Toxic impurities \nthat end up in the air are returned to the earth in the form of \nprecipitation falling on pastures, meadows, fields, gardens, and \nvegetable gardens. Polluted precipitation also falls into water \nreservoirs. The acids contained in precipitation react with \nmetals (aluminum, cadmium, mercury, lead, etc.) in the soil, and \nthey infect the water and thus the fish. \n  Precipitation is not the only source of water pollution. \nIndustrial, transport, and household wastes are dumped into \nwater reservoirs in quantities such that many rivers and lakes \ncan no longer be cleaned with existing resources. The natural \npurity of relatively shallow ground waters has been lost. \nPhosphates from wastes, the nitrates that are used everywhere as \nfertilizers, and other toxic materials have infiltrated them. \nThe situation regarding irrigation water is no better. Its \nchemical composition largely dictates the quality of \nagricultural projects, in which the content of nitrates, \nphosphates, and metals has also risen. Countries with a high \ntechnological discipline permit the use of relatively small \namounts of fertilizer. In countries with a lower technological \ndiscipline, the level is higher owing to an attempt to increase \ncrop yields. As a rule, this results in a decline in product \nquality. \n  And so, the circle has closed: People harm the environment, \nthe environment shortens their life. The child mortality rate in \nmany countries has stopped decreasing, and in several countries \nit has even begun to increase. Studies conducted by the World \nHealth Organization gave the sad results: An elevated lead \ncontent was discovered in the blood of 30 percent of neonates. \nWhere is the way out? \n  Reason suggests that, as soon as possible, further \ndestruction of nature must be halted, it must be restored on a \nplanetwide scale, and population control must be begun so as not \nto extend beyond the scope of the biosphere's objective \ncapabilities. Understanding of the fact that people's lives \ntruly depend on their effect on nature has not yet become \nwidespread. \n  It must be acknowledged that more than a few measures to \nregulate man's relationship with nature have been developed. In \nthe developed countries, where the economy is subject to market \nrelationships, energy-saving technologies are being developed \nintensively. This is making it possible to burn less fuel and, \nconsequently, reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere. \nThe manufacture of lead-free gasoline has begun, and exhaust \ngases have begun to contain far less toxic impurities. \n  Today, the search for ways of solving ecological problems is \nbeing conducted at the international, state, and sector levels. \nMany countries regularly exchange information about the current \ncondition of the environment and are creating a common \necological data bank. \n  Unfortunately, our country has not yet become sufficiently \nactively engaged in this process. And the situation in our \ncountry cannot be called good. According to existing data, about \n30 million of our citizens are living in ecological disaster \nareas. Life itself is compelling us to consider the problems of \nrestoring and protecting nature as priority problems. \n  Quality sewage treatment is not provided in 600 cities, more \nthan two thirds of toxic sources do not meet the requirements \nspecified in standards. Volumes of unutilizable toxic industrial \nwastes are increasing, and a large portion of them are \ntransported to household waste dumps or else to disorganized \nstorage sites, which eventually results in toxic materials \nending up in underground waters and water reservoirs and in \ninfection of the plant and animal world. \n  Unfortunately, the aviation industry, whose technical policy \nhas long failed to recognize ecology as a priority directly, is \na definite contributor to these negative consequences of \neconomic activity. \n  Each year, about 290,000 tons of toxic materials in the form \nof gases released from stationary sources are formed throughout \nthe sector as a whole. From them, dust- and gas-scrubbing units \ntrap 136,500 tons of toxic materials (47.1 percent), and 153,700 \ntonnes, i.e., about 0.25 percent of the total volume of wastes \nthroughout the country, are released into the atmosphere. \nConsidering the fact that the sector's enterprises are located \nin cities with an industrially developed potential, where tough \nstandards are in effect, and also, as a rule, in densely \npopulated complexes of apartment buildings, the negative effect \nof the sector's production on the environment is not always \nadequately reflected by the volumes of emissions of toxic \nmaterials. In the total mass of emissions, the greatest volume \npercentage of pollutants comes from boiler and other thermal \npower plants (36-40 percent), foundry work (15-18 percent), \npainting (14-15 percent), and engine ground tests (14-15 \npercent). The sector's production is characterized by a long \nlist of wastes. And although solid particles and hydrocarbons \npredominate in the composition of toxic materials generated \n(they account for 74.6 and 13 percent respectively), individual \nenterprises release up to 70 different toxic elements and \ncompounds into the air medium. \n  Each year, about 3,800,000 tons of ash, slag, spend molding \nand core mixtures, sediments in cleaning equipment, and other \nwastes are generated at the sector's enterprises. Of that \namount, 800,000 tons is toxic. Hundreds of thousands of tons of \nabrasive dust containing cobalt, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, \nchromium, nickel, vanadium, and other metals that are needed for \nindustry but are nevertheless harmful to the environment are \nreleased each year. \n  According to data from a 1992 inventory of sector \nenterprises \nthroughout Moscow, the total volume of toxic wastes generated \nconsists of the following: 33 percent are wastes of galvanic and \nother types of chemical treatment; 17 percent are petroleum \nproducts (oils, cutting fluids, and storm sewer slimes); 12 \npercent are wastes containing highly toxic heavy metals (dusts, \nslags, slimes); 8 percent are spent liquid organic solvents, \nhighly flammable liquids, and vat sediments left after \nregeneration of solvents; 5 percent are wastes from paint and \nvarnish production; and 21 percent are other toxic wastes. \n  The problems of ecological improvement of the sector's \nproduction and creation of new resource-saving low-waste \ntechnologies and equipment have not yet become basic and \nbinding. It should be noted, however, that the sector's \ninstitutes are definitely working in this direction. \n  The development and introduction into the sector of fluxless \nmelting of magnesium alloys and mechanization of their casting \nby using vacuum furnaces with a gas shield have made it possible \nto significantly reduce protection of the air medium and reduce \nthe toxicity of wastes (slags). Also noteworthy from the \nstandpoint of protection of the air medium and reduction of the \ntoxicity of production wastes (slags) is the development of a \nprocess and equipment for vacuum preparation (degassing) of \naluminum alloys instead of the process of refining them in \nlayers. The process has been introduced on a wide scale at \naviation industry enterprises and in other sectors. \n  Work to replace graphite during the shaped casting of \ntitanium alloys by artificial corundum by using titanium powder \nobtained from titanium wastes as a coating is now under way. \nThis will reduce the use of toxic binders (synthetic resins). \n  From an ecology standpoint, work to create processes and \nequipment for progressive automated high-precision methods of \ncasting metals and alloys with complete regeneration, recovery, \nand neutralization of the wastes generated and to introduce them \nat sector enterprises should become a priority in foundry work. \n  In the past few years, the following ecologically promising \nlow-waste processes and equipment for heat-treating components \nhave been introduced by sector enterprises: ion nitriding of \ncomponents used in basic production; vacuum nitriding of screws \nand cylinders made of titanium alloys; and heat treating \nmagnesium alloy castings in ecologically pure media (in a vacuum \nor sulfur hexafluoride gas). This has made it possible to cut \nemissions of toxic materials by a factor of 2-3. \n  In the area of machining, the NIID [expansion not given; \nDefectology Scientific Research Institute (?)] and sector \nenterprises have jointly developed and introduced the following \nlow-waste processes and equipment: \n  -- a resource-saving process involving the use of domestic \ncutting fluids instead of imported ones in the operations of \ngrinding the blanks of components made of difficult-to-machine \nmaterials that has simultaneously doubled/tripled the duration \nof cutting fluid use and permitted effective cleaning of oil \nresidues from the water in spent cutting fluids. The cost \nsavings has been in the vicinity of 850,000 rubles; \n  -- an ecologically pure process for applying reinforcing \ncoatings on a cutting tool by the vacuum ion-plasma method that \nhas made it possible to boost a tool's wear resistance by a \nfactor of 5 or 6; \n  -- a process for diamond and artificial diamond grinding of \nblades that has made it possible to reduce dust by 40 percent; \n  -- a briquetting process based on the use of plastics \n(glass-filled polyamide) to automate and mechanize the \nmanufacture of blades at a number of the subsector's enterprises \ninstead of toxic and scarce materials (alloys of the Wood's \ntype); \n  -- a process for finishing precision components of \nfuel-regulating equipment by using honing heads instead of \nfinishing treatment with abrasive pastes that has reduced \nconsumption of abrasives and, consequently, their release into \nthe atmosphere by a factor of 3. \n  In the area of installing and testing on-board systems, the \nfollowing have been developed: \n  -- ecologically pure processing for checking leaktightness \nbased on aqueous solutions of surfactants with color indication \ninstead of the oil-and-whiting method; \n  -- a stand to check the hydraulic characteristics of \npneumatic-hydraulic system components by using demineralized \nwater and a stand for comprehensive development of \npneumatic-hydraulic systems by using distillate and neural gas \n(nitrogen) instead of highly toxic working fluids and expensive \nhelium. \n  In the area of magnetic testing methods, work to introduce \ntelevision-magnetic inspection of series-produced components was \ndone in 1990-1992. This type of inspection may replace the x-ray \nand magnetic powder methods for simply shaped components made of \nmagnetic materials and would make it possible to eliminate the \nuse of x-radiation and single-use x-ray films from the \ninspection operation, as well as eliminate developer and \nfixative wastes. In the case of the television-magnetic method, \nthere are no wastes, and the magnetic tape may be used multiple \ntimes. \n  Completion of the aforesaid projects will make it possible \nto \nreduce the release of toxic materials (finely dispersed dust, \nnitrogen oxides, ozone, etc.) into the atmosphere, eliminate \ncontamination of the atmosphere and water reservoirs by highly \nflammable liquids and pollution of the atmosphere by the \nvolatile components of paints and varnishes, improve the \nsanitary and hygiene conditions of labor, reduce pollution of \nwater sources by petroleum products, etc. \n  Despite the definite work conducted by the sector with \nrespect to ecological improvement of production and creation of \nnew low-waste processes, it is, as is evident from the above \ndata, still difficult to call this activity purposive and \neffective. \n  To a certain extent, significant ecological problems arise \nduring aviation operations. The greenhouse gases \nCO[.sup]2[/], water vapor, and NO[.sub]x[/] nitric oxides \nform as kerosene burns in an aircraft engine. Efforts are \ncurrently under way to improve combustion chambers to reduce \nnitrogen oxide wastes. \n  The only way of significantly reducing or completely \neliminating these wastes, however, is to use cryogenic fuel such \nas liquefied natural gas or liquid hydrogen. The development of \ncryogenic fuel-based aviation will make it possible to eliminate \naviation's dependence on diminishing petroleum reserves. \n  Development and assimilation of the following \nprocesses/equipment are planned as priority directions of \necological improvement over the next few years: \n  -- ecologically pure processes and equipment to wash \ncomponents and subassemblies with aqueous solutions of \ncommercial detergents instead of gasoline, kerosene, and other \nhealth-damaging materials that will simultaneously make it \npossible to economize fuel and raw material resources; \n  -- a process and equipment for applying powder polymer \ncoatings onto gas turbine engine components in an electrostatic \nfield that will make it possible to eliminate paint solvent \nvapors and aerosols in the atmosphere; \n  -- systems to evacuate and recover the chloride gas medium \nused when producing diffusion coatings on gas turbine engine \ncomponents by the circulation method from the gaseous phase that \nwill result in an ecologically pure technological process; \n  -- a process and equipment for creating ecologically pure \ntechnological media for high-temperature soldering of refractory \nalloys to reduce the formation of fluoride compounds by a factor \nof 6-8; \n  -- a process and automated chambers for \nmicrocomputer-controlled high-energy plasma-torch spraying of \ncoatings to reduce the labor required for the soldering process \nby 25 percent on average. \n  These efforts will make it possible to accomplish the \nfollowing: reduce emissions of toxic materials (finely dispersed \ndust, nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc.) into the atmosphere; \neliminate pollution of the atmosphere and water reservoirs; \nimprove the sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor; eliminate \npollution of the atmosphere by paint material components; and \nreduce pollution of water sources by petroleum products. \n  The development of science-intensive processes and equipment \nand their introduction into industry are still far from \nadequate. One of the main distinguishing features of \nscience-intensive technologies and production is the fact that \nthey require little raw material and energy (i.e., they are more \nresource-saving); therefore, the wastes generated when they are \nused are not great. Water consumption in these processes is also \nmuch lower than in conventional industrial processes, which \nultimately reduces the amount of contaminated sewage. \n  Membrane, ultrasound, laser, plasma, high-speed machining, \nand progressive casting are among those resource-saving \nlow-waste and science-intensive processes that are especially \nsignificant for the sector's production on an ecological plane. \n  The sector's lack of a systems approach to solving these \nproblems is another very important reason why the work that is \nbeing done with respect to ecological improvement of industry \nand creation of new types of resource-saving low-waste processes \nhas not been effective enough. \n  According to the standard international classification \nsystem, the aviation sector is among the 10 most \nscience-intensive sectors. It is understood that the task of \nswitching the industry over to science-intensive low-waste \nprocesses in the present period under the conditions of the \nsystems of economic relationships that have developed in the \nsector, where the business agreement with enterprises has by and \nlarge become the main source of financing R&amp;D, is rather \ndifficult. \n  One of the main priority tasks related to organizing a \nsystems approach is that of developing a special integrated \nenvironmental protection program. The foundation of this program \nconsists of measures geared toward ecological improvement of the \nsector's existing production and creation of new resource-saving \nlow-waste processes with mandatory expert examination in all \nstages of development, introduction, and dissemination for the \npurpose of clarifying their ecological feasibility. \n  The technological measures planned by the sector should be \nbased on priority directions, including those in the field of \necological improvement of the sector's production as determined \nfirst and foremost by the list of enterprises, types of \nproduction and processes, and materials with the biggest \nnegative effect on the environment. \n  The technology section of the sector's integrated ecology \nprogram must contain a number of subprograms in different \ndirections of environmental protection activity. Specifically, \neach subsector must have a separate program of operations to \ncreate a process and equipment for regenerating, recovering, and \nneutralizing production and consumption wastes. \n  Expert ecological examination must be given a great deal of \nattention as a tool that makes it possible to make a \nscientifically well founded decision regarding the need to \ndevelop new technologies, as well as the need to replace and \nfurther develop ecologically imperfect technological processes, \nequipment, and materials that are in use. \n  In addition, it is necessary to have a system that makes it \npossible to conduct expert evaluations and prevent possible \nnegative ecological and economic consequences of the effect of \nthe sector's production on the environment. What is needed most \non this plane is coordination of the efforts of sector \ninstitutes in accordance with their specialization as a part of \nthe methodological, standards and related reference information, \nand technical-organizational support of such an expert \nevaluation, which should be mandatory for all associations and \nenterprises. The expert evaluation should be based on a \ncomprehensive study of the effect on the environment in several \ndirections, i.e., the effect on the air in the work zone's \natmosphere, water consumption, generation of solid waste, etc. \n  The sector's institutes now have the materials required to \nconduct expert evaluations. For example, they now have the \nfollowing: normative-reference material related to determining \nindicators for an ecological-economic evaluation of the sector's \nmanufacturing facilities from the standpoint of contamination of \nall industrial sewage; normative-reference material related to \nthe basic manufacturing processes and allocation of water with \nconsideration for its quality; a method of calculating the \nquantitative characteristics of emissions of toxic materials \ninto the atmosphere from the basic types of manufacturing \nequipment at the sector's enterprises; a \nnormative-methodological list of indicators of emissions of \nmaterials that pollute the atmosphere and civil aviation motors \nfor use in ecological evaluations and forecasts; and sector \nmethodological guidelines regarding calculating toxic emissions \nform aircraft engines. The Russian Federation Ministry of Health \nand other industrial sectors also have a number of \nmethodological materials. \n  A group of environmental protection specialists at the NIID \nare conducting a systematic check of completed scientific \nresearch work and newly developed and improved technological \nprocesses to analyze their effect on the environment and their \nconformity to the requirements of environmental protection \nlegislation so as to prevent the introduction of technological \nprocesses that do not meet the requirements of environmental \nprotection and rational use of natural resources. \n  The training of engineering personnel both in institutes and \nin enterprises for the purpose of providing them with the \nrequired body of modern ecological knowledge acquires great \nimportance in this respect. \n  Only when specialists have in-depth knowledge of the \ninteraction of nature and society, the consequences of \nindustrial pollution of the environment, rational methods and \nways of using nature, the requirements of environmental \nprotection legislation, ways of protecting the environment \nagainst industrial emissions, ways of estimating the damage done \nto nature, and other matters will they be capable of actively \nintroducing expert ecological examinations into the sector, \nincreasing its quality, and consequently producing a product \nthat is not ecologically harmful. \n  Purposive and effective work toward ecological improvement \nof \nthe sector's production based on resource-saving and low-waste \ntechnology is impossible without significant improvement of \norganizational work in this direction. \n  In this regard, special attention must be paid to developing \norganizational methodological materials to support the use of \nrecyclable material resources in the national economy. \n  The problem of increasing the effectiveness and rational use \nof recyclable material resources is one of the most important \nproblems in the sector's production. Hundreds of thousands of \ntons of recyclable material resources pile up at the sector's \nenterprises each year. Table 1 presents the volumes of the \ngeneration, use, and destruction of recyclable material \nresources in the sector in 1991. It is evident from Table 1 that \nbetween 4 and 83 percent of recyclable material resources is \ndestroyed depending on the type of resource. The main thrust of \nthe sector's economic strategy is effective use of recyclable \nmaterial resources in production, the main directions of which \nare presented in Table 2. \n"
FBIS3-42459,"The Mosaeroshow-92 Russian International Aerospace \nExhibition took place on 11-16 August 1992 in the Moscow suburb \nof Zhukovskiy. The Flying-Research Institute (LII) imeni M.M. \nGromov, Aviaeksport Association, and the German firm Glahe \nInternational organized it. The exhibition received experts and \njournalists from 11 through 14 August and everyone who wished to \nattend on 15 and 16 August, and an air show was conducted on 16 \nAugust in honor of Air Force Day. \n  The exhibition took place at an airfield belonging to LII, \nthe main VPP [runway] of which is 5,500 meters long. There are \nno such large airfields in Europe, and only the airfield at \nEdwards Air Base in the United States can be compared to it. \nRussia spent 85 million rubles [R] to organize the air show, of \nwhich R60 million was spent on construction of roads and city \ninfrastructure and R25 million on development of the exhibition \ncomplex itself. A portion of the expenditures was covered by the \ncost of entry tickets. With the price of a ticket at R30, the \namount of proceeds from entry payments totaled more than R8 \nmillion and, considering the lease payments by the exhibitors, \nwe can assume that a large portion of the cost of the exhibition \ncomplex was covered. \n  The Mosaeroshow-92 organizers managed to develop the \naerospace exhibition complex in a record short period of time \n(3.5 months). The exhibition complex hardly lags behind the most \nfamous aircraft exhibition complex in the world at Le Bourget \n(near Paris). \n  The opportunity that was offered to domestic aerospace \nenterprises to show their items at Mosaeroshow-92 completely \nmeets the assigned task to market domestic products. This \nopportunity is valuable first of all for the producers and \ndevelopers of aircraft equipment, few of whom are capable of \nsystematically participating in foreign exhibitions. \n  According to data cited in a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interview with \nOKB [Experimental Design Bureau] imeni A.I. Mikoyan general \ndesigner R.A. Belkov, in 1991 not a single aircraft from their \nOKB was sold abroad. A dramatic decline in exports was observed \nin the entire domestic defense industry in 1991. A certain bias \non the part of a number of potential foreign purchasers \nregarding Russian arms as a result of their unsuccessful \nemployment during the course of the Persian Gulf War is among \nthe primary causes of this, as well as the lack of \nsophistication of domestic sales structures and possible \npressure on the Russian Government by the United States. \nExhibitions of the Mosaeroshow-92 type will help to disperse \nthe bias arising from inadequately thorough analysis of combat \noperations and knowledge of Russian equipment. \n"
FBIS3-42854,"I have been telling my Western colleagues that had \nthey had a steep price hike like we had in Estonia, they would \nhave had rioting in the streets, says energy minister Arvo \nNiitenberg smugly, as he recalls the economic crisis of the 70's \nin the United States. At that time, Americans raised the price \nof a liter of gasoline by 10 cents, and there were incidents of \nshooting at gas stations. Estonia's energetics has survived a \nmajor price shock over the past two years. Coal, heating oil, \nnatural gas, diesel fuel and gasoline have been brought to world \nmarket prices. Oil shale and electricity are not at world \nmarket prices, says Niitenberg, satisfied that Estonia has \nmoved into world economy. The price of gasoline in Estonia and \nthe world price of unprocessed crude are now linked. \n  One dramatic example of relentlessly rising prices is the \n754-time jump in the price of natural gas, as compared to the \nSoviet era. The minister believes that our energy policy which, \nin its formative stages, drew praise from its teachers like the \nWorld Bank, the European Bank of Development and Reconstruction, \nand other organizations, will make Estonia stronger in the \nfuture. The days of wasting cheap energy are over. \n<H5>  No More Sudden Price Hikes </H5>\n  As is happening elsewhere, the price of energy in Estonia \nwill still be going up, but I don't foresee any sudden jumps, \nsays Niitenberg and finds that the price of electricity, for \nexample, is favorably low, compared to some of our neighbors. He \ndoes not believe that the price of electricity will ever go up \nto Finland's level (5 times higher than ours), and that Estonia \nwill always have an advantage. Electricity is unnaturally cheap \nin Russia but, compared to other neighboring states, Estonian \nproducers enjoy a certain advantage. \n  While the consumption of electricity has been going up \nlately, the demand for liquid fuel has been dropping. During \n1993, only 600,000 tonnes of heating oil were consumed, compared \nto its previous consumption levels of up to 1,600,000 tonnes a \nyear. \n  Part of that difference is attributable to user economy, \nthe \nrest to a general economic decline. I believe we can increase \nproduction without drastically increasing the demand for energy. \nWe have to reduce the energy loss that currently amounts to \nroughly one third of the total. If that part of the energy could \nbe used to develop the economy, energy expenditures would not \nhave to go up for the time being, Niitenberg says. As an \nexample, he cites Denmark, where energy consumption goes up by \nless than 1 percent, yet the economy is developing at a much \nfaster rate. This is the result of energy conservation programs. \nThe Danes have made a transition to more modern heating systems, \nthey have financing. Estonia, by contrast, is plagued by lack of \ncapital. \n<H5>  The Proportion of Domestic Fuel Is Small </H5>\n  For the development of energetics, we have received loans \nfrom the European Community totaling 76.7 million Estonian \nkroons. With that money, more than 140 energy-related projects \nhave been carried out in different parts of Estonia. These have \nbeen mostly small plants for local parish use, installed to make \na transition to domestic fuel, and to reduce energy loss, \nNiitenberg says. \n  The proportion of domestic fuel sources is currently not as \ngreat in Estonia as it is in our neighboring countries. Timber \nand peat provide 3.5 percent of the necessary energy. In the \nNordic countries, this share is roughly 7 percent; in Finland \nbetween 12 and 13 percent. \n  It would be possible to increase the share of timber and \npeat to 10 percent. It is interesting to note that, even though \nEstonia imports much of its fuel, close to 70 percent of the \nenergy is obtained locally. In this respect we are much better \noff than Latvia or Lithuania. We have oil shale, electricity, \ntimber and peat, only liquid fuel and natural gas are brought \nin, Niitenberg says. \n<H5>  Estonia Needs an Explosives Plant </H5>\n  Out of the production cost for oil shale, one third goes for \nexplosives which, for the time being, are still coming from our \neastern neighbors. Prices of explosives and fuses have gone up \nand that, in turn, has jacked up the price of oil shale. Eesti \nPÅolevkivi [Estonian Oil Shale] is in the process of \nnegotiating with a Swedish and a German firm for putting up an \nexplosives plant in Estonia, specifically for mining. Depending \non technology, this will require an investment of roughly $5 to \n$10 million. A study is being conducted to show how fast the \nplant can pay for itself. \n  Last year, 13.5 million tonnes of oil shale were produced \nin \nEstonia, and I cannot see that volume going down in the near \nfuture. We can tell potential foreign buyers that the market is \nstable, and give them certain guarantees, Niitenberg thinks. \n<H5>  Send Us Pressure Pipe, Not Experts </H5>\n  Both firms are interested, but are still busy looking for \nmarketing possibilities in other nearby regions. Niitenberg \nthinks there are certain advantages to investing in Estonia. It \nis not like dealing with the Third World countries, who cannot \nmanage on their own. We have technical know-how and an \nindustrial infra-structure. All we need is modern technology. \n  In my dealings with foreigners, I have had to repeat, time \nand again, please believe me, we also have experts. We would \nrather have 300 meters of pressure pipe than seven experts, \nsays Niitenberg, convinced that Estonia can offer some excellent \nspecialists in the area of energetics. In addition to capital, \nwe also lack the skill of organizing the work. \n<H5>  A Strategic Reserve Would Be Necessary </H5>\n  Lack of capital also stands in the way of creating a \nstrategic reserve of fuel. Niitenberg is a believer in having \nstrategic reserves, the only question being what is the most \neffective way of using the financial resources available. For \nEstonia to to maintain a three-month reserve of liquid fuel, \nwould tie up $300 to $400 million. \n  Estonia is not rich enough to let such amounts sit idle. \nFirst, a decision needs to be made how much of a reserve should \nbe maintained. This presumes that we know what we want to be \ninsured against. We have the facilities for storing liquid fuel, \nbut not for natural gas, 100 percent of which comes in from \nRussia. Putting those up would take an extremely large \ninvestment, the closest usable storage facilities are located in \nLatvia, Niitenberg says, adding that the question of strategic \nreserves has been discussed in government and has been assigned \nto the working group of the Economic Ministry. The problem is \nwider in scope, and includes the areas of medicine, food and \nother such. \n<H5>  Refining Plant To Cost $1 Billion </H5>\n  Canada, where Niitenberg worked for many years in leading \npositions within the energy system, had a relatively low level \nof reserves. Emphasis was placed on infra-structure, making sure \nthat fuel could be moved immediately whenever needed. The \nreserves of liquid fuel were distributed between big oil \ncompanies, with the state keeping track of how fast some company \nor other could obtain a certain quantity of fuel. Most of the \nresponsibility was borne by Petro Canada, a company similar to \nour Eesti KÆutus [Estonian Fuel]. There is always the \nquestion: Can the state place an obligation on a private company? \n  In case of a possible crisis, we have two choices. Either \nwe \nhave barrels stored somewhere, or we have a firm plan for how to \ntransport the necessary amount of fuel from some refining plant \nin Denmark or Poland to Estonia within three days. Putting up \nour own plant would require a capital outlay of $800 to $900 \nmillion, whereas transportation, storage and other support \nservices for import have improved significantly as of late. \n  In Canada, I dealt with electricity that could not be kept \nin reserve. For unexpected situations, alternatives had to be \nfound, Niitenberg says. \n<H5>  A Nuclear Plant Does Not Have To Be Hazardous </H5>\n  Among specialists, there has also been talk about putting up \na nuclear power plant in Estonia. Speaking of money, Niitenberg \nvolunteered the cost of the Darlington nuclear power plant as an \nexample. Ontario Hydro, the Canadian company where Niitenberg \nworked before coming to Estonia, and where he still has a \nposition waiting for him, invested 14 billion Canadian dollars \nin building this 3,600 MW capacity power plant. This project, \ndesigned for an operating life of 30 to 40 years, is not \nexpected to turn a profit for the first 10 years. \n  The possibility of putting up a nuclear power plant should \nbe analyzed, above all, from an economic point of view. If the \npotential profit is a mere two cents per kilowatt, it will \nobviously not be worth the risk. It would be a completely \ndifferent situation, however, if the nuclear plant would enable \nus to produce electricity at half the previous cost. One of the \nbiggest burdens imaginable is a nuclear plant that does not work \nefficiently or does not have a sufficient load. However, atomic \npower plants can turn out to be extremely profitable. We should \nnot dismiss any of the alternatives on simply emotional grounds, \neven though we know what happened at Chernobyl and what is going \non in Paldiski, where the biggest danger is over by now, says \nNiitenberg, who was in charge of 20 nuclear power plants in \nCanada, and who has a daughter involved in liquidating nuclear \npower plant accidents. \n  As long as everything is well organized, this field is not \nas dangerous as it is thought to be. If that were not so, I \nwould not have allowed my daughter to work in this field. It is \nsignificant that, in accordance with international agreements, \ninformation should be disclosed on any accident so that \nappropriate conclusions could be drawn by nuclear energy \nspecialists in neighboring countries and throughout the world. \nAt Chernobyl, this agreement was violated, Niitenberg explained. \n<H5>  Future Will Bring New Solutions </H5>\n  Niitenberg thinks that this issue will not come up on \nEstonia's agenda before the year 2000, for sure, and that it \nwill take a political decision, in principle, either by \npoliticians or by a referendum. \n  As far as the future of energetics for the whole world goes, \nNiitenberg does not deign offer anything specific. \n  If I knew the solution, I would become a very rich man, he \nlaughs and thinks that bio-energetics will develop, for sure. \nAlso feasible is the so-called fusion method, which \nis the next step in harnessing nuclear energy, based on the \nability of heavy hydrogen isotopes to combine into helium at \nextremely high temperatures, yielding energy from the neutron \nthus released. \n  To the question about current fuel reserves and how long \nthey \nwill last, Niitenberg replies with another question: For what \nkind of money? Canada has supposedly more crude oil than all \nArab countries combined but, due to natural conditions, pumping \nit out would cost 30 times more than the current norm. \n"
FBIS3-43002,"Engineering Academy, B.Ye. Karasev, doctor of technical sciences \nand academician, International Information Academy, A.V. \nLogunov, corresponding member, International Engineering \nAcademy, and V.D. Matyushin, candidate of technical sciences, \nNIID [expansion not given]; boldface as published in source \ntext; UDC 502.7] \n  [Text] Under the conditions of continuous intensification \nof production, the problem of environmental protection and \nrational use of natural resources is becoming increasingly \nsocially and economically significant. Included among the \nmatters classified under this problem are the following: \npollution of the water and air by toxic industrial wastes, toxic \nchemicals, and radioactive materials; prevention of harmful \nconsequences of the use of pesticides to fight pests and \ndiseases in agriculture and forestry; soil erosion and \nrecultivation; further development of the legal bases of \nenvironmental protection; and economic assessment of natural \nresources. \n  The development of production, scientific and engineering \nprogress, and expansion of human industrial activity must not \ndestroy the harmony that has been established in nature or \ndestroy natural resources. There are no wastes in nature: All \nbiological, chemical, and physical processes occur in a closed \ncircle. \n  All industrial enterprises affect the environment to some \ndegree or other. Research has shown that at least one third of \nall processible raw material is now transformed into finished \nproducts. Consequently, the remaining fraction of raw materials \nbecomes wastes that are often harmful to the environment. In the \npast decade, the volume of industrial wastes released into the \natmosphere in conjunction with the rapid increase in industrial \ndevelopment has increased sharply and continues to increase. \nEach year, industrial enterprises, thermal electric power \nplants, motor vehicles, blast furnaces, aircraft engines, and \nother machines release hundreds of millions of tons of carbon in \nthe form of oxides, primarily carbon dioxide, into the \natmosphere. \n  The carbon dioxide released by humans and the animal world \nis \nabsorbed by plant life to provide a stable state of equilibrium \nin the atmosphere. Unfortunately, this equilibrium has now been \nupset, and the alarm of ecological catastrophe is sounding \nlouder with each passing year. The continuing increase in the \nconcentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an \nespecially negative phenomenon. Carbon dioxide is known to be \ntoxic in large quantities: It causes hypoxia and debilitated \nrespiration and cardiac activity. An increase in carbon dioxide \nconcentration not only has a direct effect on organisms but also \nfacilitates an increase in absorption of the earth's thermal \nradiation by the atmosphere, which in turn results in climate \nwarming throughout the entire planet. As is known, in the past \n100 years, the average temperature of the earth's surface \nincreased by 0.5-0.6ë, which has in turn accelerated glacial \nthawing and increased the sea's level by 1.5-2 m. \n  Also released along with carbon dioxide during the \ncombustion \nprocess is carbon monoxide, which has an even more toxic effect \nand which may result in debilitation of many vital functions, \nincluding illness of the central nervous system. \n  Metallurgy plants and thermal power plants release a large \namount of sulfur dioxide. Fossil fuels also contain a great deal \nof sulfur. Each year, about 30 million tons of sulfurous gas are \nreleased in our country. When sulfur dioxide reacts with \natmospheric moisture, sulfurous and sulfuric acids form. When \nnitrogen-containing coal and oil are burned, oxides are formed \nthat combine with atmospheric moisture to yield nitrous and \nnitric acids. These acids may cause serious lung diseases. \n  Ecological and sanitary and hygiene estimates are formulated \non the basis of data about emissions of pollutants into the \natmosphere. \n  In nature, everything is interconnected. Toxic impurities \nthat end up in the air are returned to the earth in the form of \nprecipitation falling on pastures, meadows, fields, gardens, and \nvegetable gardens. Polluted precipitation also falls into water \nreservoirs. The acids contained in precipitation react with \nmetals (aluminum, cadmium, mercury, lead, etc.) in the soil, and \nthey infect the water and thus the fish. \n  Precipitation is not the only source of water pollution. \nIndustrial, transport, and household wastes are dumped into \nwater reservoirs in quantities such that many rivers and lakes \ncan no longer be cleaned with existing resources. The natural \npurity of relatively shallow ground waters has been lost. \nPhosphates from wastes, the nitrates that are used everywhere as \nfertilizers, and other toxic materials have infiltrated them. \nThe situation regarding irrigation water is no better. Its \nchemical composition largely dictates the quality of \nagricultural projects, in which the content of nitrates, \nphosphates, and metals has also risen. Countries with a high \ntechnological discipline permit the use of relatively small \namounts of fertilizer. In countries with a lower technological \ndiscipline, the level is higher owing to an attempt to increase \ncrop yields. As a rule, this results in a decline in product \nquality. \n  And so, the circle has closed: People harm the environment, \nthe environment shortens their life. The child mortality rate in \nmany countries has stopped decreasing, and in several countries \nit has even begun to increase. Studies conducted by the World \nHealth Organization gave the sad results: An elevated lead \ncontent was discovered in the blood of 30 percent of neonates. \nWhere is the way out? \n  Reason suggests that, as soon as possible, further \ndestruction of nature must be halted, it must be restored on a \nplanetwide scale, and population control must be begun so as not \nto extend beyond the scope of the biosphere's objective \ncapabilities. Understanding of the fact that people's lives \ntruly depend on their effect on nature has not yet become \nwidespread. \n  It must be acknowledged that more than a few measures to \nregulate man's relationship with nature have been developed. In \nthe developed countries, where the economy is subject to market \nrelationships, energy-saving technologies are being developed \nintensively. This is making it possible to burn less fuel and, \nconsequently, reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere. \nThe manufacture of lead-free gasoline has begun, and exhaust \ngases have begun to contain far less toxic impurities. \n  Today, the search for ways of solving ecological problems is \nbeing conducted at the international, state, and sector levels. \nMany countries regularly exchange information about the current \ncondition of the environment and are creating a common \necological data bank. \n  Unfortunately, our country has not yet become sufficiently \nactively engaged in this process. And the situation in our \ncountry cannot be called good. According to existing data, about \n30 million of our citizens are living in ecological disaster \nareas. Life itself is compelling us to consider the problems of \nrestoring and protecting nature as priority problems. \n  Quality sewage treatment is not provided in 600 cities, more \nthan two thirds of toxic sources do not meet the requirements \nspecified in standards. Volumes of unutilizable toxic industrial \nwastes are increasing, and a large portion of them are \ntransported to household waste dumps or else to disorganized \nstorage sites, which eventually results in toxic materials \nending up in underground waters and water reservoirs and in \ninfection of the plant and animal world. \n  Unfortunately, the aviation industry, whose technical policy \nhas long failed to recognize ecology as a priority directly, is \na definite contributor to these negative consequences of \neconomic activity. \n  Each year, about 290,000 tons of toxic materials in the form \nof gases released from stationary sources are formed throughout \nthe sector as a whole. From them, dust- and gas-scrubbing units \ntrap 136,500 tons of toxic materials (47.1 percent), and 153,700 \ntonnes, i.e., about 0.25 percent of the total volume of wastes \nthroughout the country, are released into the atmosphere. \nConsidering the fact that the sector's enterprises are located \nin cities with an industrially developed potential, where tough \nstandards are in effect, and also, as a rule, in densely \npopulated complexes of apartment buildings, the negative effect \nof the sector's production on the environment is not always \nadequately reflected by the volumes of emissions of toxic \nmaterials. In the total mass of emissions, the greatest volume \npercentage of pollutants comes from boiler and other thermal \npower plants (36-40 percent), foundry work (15-18 percent), \npainting (14-15 percent), and engine ground tests (14-15 \npercent). The sector's production is characterized by a long \nlist of wastes. And although solid particles and hydrocarbons \npredominate in the composition of toxic materials generated \n(they account for 74.6 and 13 percent respectively), individual \nenterprises release up to 70 different toxic elements and \ncompounds into the air medium. \n  Each year, about 3,800,000 tons of ash, slag, spend molding \nand core mixtures, sediments in cleaning equipment, and other \nwastes are generated at the sector's enterprises. Of that \namount, 800,000 tons is toxic. Hundreds of thousands of tons of \nabrasive dust containing cobalt, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, \nchromium, nickel, vanadium, and other metals that are needed for \nindustry but are nevertheless harmful to the environment are \nreleased each year. \n  According to data from a 1992 inventory of sector \nenterprises \nthroughout Moscow, the total volume of toxic wastes generated \nconsists of the following: 33 percent are wastes of galvanic and \nother types of chemical treatment; 17 percent are petroleum \nproducts (oils, cutting fluids, and storm sewer slimes); 12 \npercent are wastes containing highly toxic heavy metals (dusts, \nslags, slimes); 8 percent are spent liquid organic solvents, \nhighly flammable liquids, and vat sediments left after \nregeneration of solvents; 5 percent are wastes from paint and \nvarnish production; and 21 percent are other toxic wastes. \n  The problems of ecological improvement of the sector's \nproduction and creation of new resource-saving low-waste \ntechnologies and equipment have not yet become basic and \nbinding. It should be noted, however, that the sector's \ninstitutes are definitely working in this direction. \n  The development and introduction into the sector of fluxless \nmelting of magnesium alloys and mechanization of their casting \nby using vacuum furnaces with a gas shield have made it possible \nto significantly reduce protection of the air medium and reduce \nthe toxicity of wastes (slags). Also noteworthy from the \nstandpoint of protection of the air medium and reduction of the \ntoxicity of production wastes (slags) is the development of a \nprocess and equipment for vacuum preparation (degassing) of \naluminum alloys instead of the process of refining them in \nlayers. The process has been introduced on a wide scale at \naviation industry enterprises and in other sectors. \n  Work to replace graphite during the shaped casting of \ntitanium alloys by artificial corundum by using titanium powder \nobtained from titanium wastes as a coating is now under way. \nThis will reduce the use of toxic binders (synthetic resins). \n  From an ecology standpoint, work to create processes and \nequipment for progressive automated high-precision methods of \ncasting metals and alloys with complete regeneration, recovery, \nand neutralization of the wastes generated and to introduce them \nat sector enterprises should become a priority in foundry work. \n  In the past few years, the following ecologically promising \nlow-waste processes and equipment for heat-treating components \nhave been introduced by sector enterprises: ion nitriding of \ncomponents used in basic production; vacuum nitriding of screws \nand cylinders made of titanium alloys; and heat treating \nmagnesium alloy castings in ecologically pure media (in a vacuum \nor sulfur hexafluoride gas). This has made it possible to cut \nemissions of toxic materials by a factor of 2-3. \n  In the area of machining, the NIID [expansion not given; \nDefectology Scientific Research Institute (?)] and sector \nenterprises have jointly developed and introduced the following \nlow-waste processes and equipment: \n  -- a resource-saving process involving the use of domestic \ncutting fluids instead of imported ones in the operations of \ngrinding the blanks of components made of difficult-to-machine \nmaterials that has simultaneously doubled/tripled the duration \nof cutting fluid use and permitted effective cleaning of oil \nresidues from the water in spent cutting fluids. The cost \nsavings has been in the vicinity of 850,000 rubles; \n  -- an ecologically pure process for applying reinforcing \ncoatings on a cutting tool by the vacuum ion-plasma method that \nhas made it possible to boost a tool's wear resistance by a \nfactor of 5 or 6; \n  -- a process for diamond and artificial diamond grinding of \nblades that has made it possible to reduce dust by 40 percent; \n  -- a briquetting process based on the use of plastics \n(glass-filled polyamide) to automate and mechanize the \nmanufacture of blades at a number of the subsector's enterprises \ninstead of toxic and scarce materials (alloys of the Wood's \ntype); \n  -- a process for finishing precision components of \nfuel-regulating equipment by using honing heads instead of \nfinishing treatment with abrasive pastes that has reduced \nconsumption of abrasives and, consequently, their release into \nthe atmosphere by a factor of 3. \n  In the area of installing and testing on-board systems, the \nfollowing have been developed: \n  -- ecologically pure processing for checking leaktightness \nbased on aqueous solutions of surfactants with color indication \ninstead of the oil-and-whiting method; \n  -- a stand to check the hydraulic characteristics of \npneumatic-hydraulic system components by using demineralized \nwater and a stand for comprehensive development of \npneumatic-hydraulic systems by using distillate and neural gas \n(nitrogen) instead of highly toxic working fluids and expensive \nhelium. \n  In the area of magnetic testing methods, work to introduce \ntelevision-magnetic inspection of series-produced components was \ndone in 1990-1992. This type of inspection may replace the x-ray \nand magnetic powder methods for simply shaped components made of \nmagnetic materials and would make it possible to eliminate the \nuse of x-radiation and single-use x-ray films from the \ninspection operation, as well as eliminate developer and \nfixative wastes. In the case of the television-magnetic method, \nthere are no wastes, and the magnetic tape may be used multiple \ntimes. \n  Completion of the aforesaid projects will make it possible \nto \nreduce the release of toxic materials (finely dispersed dust, \nnitrogen oxides, ozone, etc.) into the atmosphere, eliminate \ncontamination of the atmosphere and water reservoirs by highly \nflammable liquids and pollution of the atmosphere by the \nvolatile components of paints and varnishes, improve the \nsanitary and hygiene conditions of labor, reduce pollution of \nwater sources by petroleum products, etc. \n  Despite the definite work conducted by the sector with \nrespect to ecological improvement of production and creation of \nnew low-waste processes, it is, as is evident from the above \ndata, still difficult to call this activity purposive and \neffective. \n  To a certain extent, significant ecological problems arise \nduring aviation operations. The greenhouse gases \nCO[.sup]2[/], water vapor, and NO[.sub]x[/] nitric oxides \nform as kerosene burns in an aircraft engine. Efforts are \ncurrently under way to improve combustion chambers to reduce \nnitrogen oxide wastes. \n  The only way of significantly reducing or completely \neliminating these wastes, however, is to use cryogenic fuel such \nas liquefied natural gas or liquid hydrogen. The development of \ncryogenic fuel-based aviation will make it possible to eliminate \naviation's dependence on diminishing petroleum reserves. \n  Development and assimilation of the following \nprocesses/equipment are planned as priority directions of \necological improvement over the next few years: \n  -- ecologically pure processes and equipment to wash \ncomponents and subassemblies with aqueous solutions of \ncommercial detergents instead of gasoline, kerosene, and other \nhealth-damaging materials that will simultaneously make it \npossible to economize fuel and raw material resources; \n  -- a process and equipment for applying powder polymer \ncoatings onto gas turbine engine components in an electrostatic \nfield that will make it possible to eliminate paint solvent \nvapors and aerosols in the atmosphere; \n  -- systems to evacuate and recover the chloride gas medium \nused when producing diffusion coatings on gas turbine engine \ncomponents by the circulation method from the gaseous phase that \nwill result in an ecologically pure technological process; \n  -- a process and equipment for creating ecologically pure \ntechnological media for high-temperature soldering of refractory \nalloys to reduce the formation of fluoride compounds by a factor \nof 6-8; \n  -- a process and automated chambers for \nmicrocomputer-controlled high-energy plasma-torch spraying of \ncoatings to reduce the labor required for the soldering process \nby 25 percent on average. \n  These efforts will make it possible to accomplish the \nfollowing: reduce emissions of toxic materials (finely dispersed \ndust, nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc.) into the atmosphere; \neliminate pollution of the atmosphere and water reservoirs; \nimprove the sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor; eliminate \npollution of the atmosphere by paint material components; and \nreduce pollution of water sources by petroleum products. \n  The development of science-intensive processes and equipment \nand their introduction into industry are still far from \nadequate. One of the main distinguishing features of \nscience-intensive technologies and production is the fact that \nthey require little raw material and energy (i.e., they are more \nresource-saving); therefore, the wastes generated when they are \nused are not great. Water consumption in these processes is also \nmuch lower than in conventional industrial processes, which \nultimately reduces the amount of contaminated sewage. \n  Membrane, ultrasound, laser, plasma, high-speed machining, \nand progressive casting are among those resource-saving \nlow-waste and science-intensive processes that are especially \nsignificant for the sector's production on an ecological plane. \n  The sector's lack of a systems approach to solving these \nproblems is another very important reason why the work that is \nbeing done with respect to ecological improvement of industry \nand creation of new types of resource-saving low-waste processes \nhas not been effective enough. \n  According to the standard international classification \nsystem, the aviation sector is among the 10 most \nscience-intensive sectors. It is understood that the task of \nswitching the industry over to science-intensive low-waste \nprocesses in the present period under the conditions of the \nsystems of economic relationships that have developed in the \nsector, where the business agreement with enterprises has by and \nlarge become the main source of financing R&amp;D, is rather \ndifficult. \n  One of the main priority tasks related to organizing a \nsystems approach is that of developing a special integrated \nenvironmental protection program. The foundation of this program \nconsists of measures geared toward ecological improvement of the \nsector's existing production and creation of new resource-saving \nlow-waste processes with mandatory expert examination in all \nstages of development, introduction, and dissemination for the \npurpose of clarifying their ecological feasibility. \n  The technological measures planned by the sector should be \nbased on priority directions, including those in the field of \necological improvement of the sector's production as determined \nfirst and foremost by the list of enterprises, types of \nproduction and processes, and materials with the biggest \nnegative effect on the environment. \n  The technology section of the sector's integrated ecology \nprogram must contain a number of subprograms in different \ndirections of environmental protection activity. Specifically, \neach subsector must have a separate program of operations to \ncreate a process and equipment for regenerating, recovering, and \nneutralizing production and consumption wastes. \n  Expert ecological examination must be given a great deal of \nattention as a tool that makes it possible to make a \nscientifically well founded decision regarding the need to \ndevelop new technologies, as well as the need to replace and \nfurther develop ecologically imperfect technological processes, \nequipment, and materials that are in use. \n  In addition, it is necessary to have a system that makes it \npossible to conduct expert evaluations and prevent possible \nnegative ecological and economic consequences of the effect of \nthe sector's production on the environment. What is needed most \non this plane is coordination of the efforts of sector \ninstitutes in accordance with their specialization as a part of \nthe methodological, standards and related reference information, \nand technical-organizational support of such an expert \nevaluation, which should be mandatory for all associations and \nenterprises. The expert evaluation should be based on a \ncomprehensive study of the effect on the environment in several \ndirections, i.e., the effect on the air in the work zone's \natmosphere, water consumption, generation of solid waste, etc. \n  The sector's institutes now have the materials required to \nconduct expert evaluations. For example, they now have the \nfollowing: normative-reference material related to determining \nindicators for an ecological-economic evaluation of the sector's \nmanufacturing facilities from the standpoint of contamination of \nall industrial sewage; normative-reference material related to \nthe basic manufacturing processes and allocation of water with \nconsideration for its quality; a method of calculating the \nquantitative characteristics of emissions of toxic materials \ninto the atmosphere from the basic types of manufacturing \nequipment at the sector's enterprises; a \nnormative-methodological list of indicators of emissions of \nmaterials that pollute the atmosphere and civil aviation motors \nfor use in ecological evaluations and forecasts; and sector \nmethodological guidelines regarding calculating toxic emissions \nform aircraft engines. The Russian Federation Ministry of Health \nand other industrial sectors also have a number of \nmethodological materials. \n  A group of environmental protection specialists at the NIID \nare conducting a systematic check of completed scientific \nresearch work and newly developed and improved technological \nprocesses to analyze their effect on the environment and their \nconformity to the requirements of environmental protection \nlegislation so as to prevent the introduction of technological \nprocesses that do not meet the requirements of environmental \nprotection and rational use of natural resources. \n  The training of engineering personnel both in institutes and \nin enterprises for the purpose of providing them with the \nrequired body of modern ecological knowledge acquires great \nimportance in this respect. \n  Only when specialists have in-depth knowledge of the \ninteraction of nature and society, the consequences of \nindustrial pollution of the environment, rational methods and \nways of using nature, the requirements of environmental \nprotection legislation, ways of protecting the environment \nagainst industrial emissions, ways of estimating the damage done \nto nature, and other matters will they be capable of actively \nintroducing expert ecological examinations into the sector, \nincreasing its quality, and consequently producing a product \nthat is not ecologically harmful. \n  Purposive and effective work toward ecological improvement \nof \nthe sector's production based on resource-saving and low-waste \ntechnology is impossible without significant improvement of \norganizational work in this direction. \n  In this regard, special attention must be paid to developing \norganizational methodological materials to support the use of \nrecyclable material resources in the national economy. \n  The problem of increasing the effectiveness and rational use \nof recyclable material resources is one of the most important \nproblems in the sector's production. Hundreds of thousands of \ntons of recyclable material resources pile up at the sector's \nenterprises each year. Table 1 presents the volumes of the \ngeneration, use, and destruction of recyclable material \nresources in the sector in 1991. It is evident from Table 1 that \nbetween 4 and 83 percent of recyclable material resources is \ndestroyed depending on the type of resource. The main thrust of \nthe sector's economic strategy is effective use of recyclable \nmaterial resources in production, the main directions of which \nare presented in Table 2. \n"
FBIS3-43108,"The increasing stringency of the requirements \nimposed on the economic and environmental indicators of aircraft \ngas turbine engines (AGTD) brought to the forefront the issue of \nusing liquefied hydrogen or natural gas as motor fuel which \ncalls for preliminary fuel gasification in a special heat \nexchanger. The development of such heat exchangers-gasifiers is \nfraught with a number of problems, e.g., selecting the heat \nexchanger location, ensuring a stable cryogenic fuel flow in the \nheat exchanger channels, selecting the fuel preheating regime, \netc. The solution to these problems is complicated by a lack of \nreliable design methods. To bridge this gap, an attempt is made \nto develop an analysis technique using the example of heat \nexchanger-gasifiers for NK-88 and NK-89 engines. The design of \nthe heat exchanger and heat and mass transfer processes during \ncryogenic fuel gasification are described in detail, a \nmathematical model of the process is formulated, and an \nalgorithm for solving the resulting equations is proposed. The \nanalytical method of designing heat exchangers for cryogenic \nfuel gasification with two-phase flow conditions inside the \npipes and frosting on the outside surface is verified \nexperimentally. The maximum spread between the analytical and \nexperimental data is within 15-25% which attests to the \nmathematical model's adequacy for practical applications. \nFigures 4; tables 1; references 7: 6 Russian, 1 Western. \n"
FBIS3-41958,"It has increased its research effort in the sectors \nit covers and, something new, it is working as an agency by \npublishing and distributing the results of its activities \nthroughout Italy. \n  With over 5,000 employees, nine large research centers, and \nother smaller areas where it is working, ENEA [Agency for New \nTechnologies, Energy, and the Environment] is present throughout \nItaly. \n  Amongst its new lines of intervention there are plans for \nthe \ntransfer and distribution of innovation to production, industry \nand agriculture, the development of components and technologies \nfor the utilization of renewable sources of energy and energy \nsaving, as well as research and experimentation of innovative \nnuclear reactors that are safer than those of the past. \n  This redefinition of its areas of competence is laying the \nfoundations for the ENEA of the year 2000. It will be a \nproducer of technological and managerial culture, and be at the \nservice, in particular, of the manufacturing world. \n  Nicola Cabibbo, whom we have interviewed, has recently been \ncalled to direct this research giant. He is a scientist who is \nwell known and respected by the international scientific \ncommunity, and has come from the presidency of the INFN [Italian \nNational Institute for Nuclear Physics]. \n  Prestipino: Prof. Cabibbo, the handbook of the \nnew ENEA is definitely the 1993-95 three-year program, that was \npublished in December 1992 and presents the programs and new \nobjectives of the agency in 115 pages. How much of this \nreflects the situation of the old agency and how much describes \nthe new one? \n  Cabibbo: Let us say immediately that this is a \nsliding plan, that has suffered from the time when it was \ndrawn up, and allows for changes of direction as it goes along. \nThe developments of the coming years will influence the way it \nis followed. \n  Prestipino: It has been said that the plan is \nalready old or that anyway it reflects the ideas of the old \nagency. \n  Cabibbo: When I arrived at the ENEA I did not \nconsider reviewing the plan because it is a lengthy procedure. \nPerhaps I will participate in the preparation of the next one. \nLet us not forget that it has been approved at ministerial \nlevel. \n  I think that it is very important for the agency to focus \nits \nactivities better. Its nuclear activity having been \ninterrupted, ENEA has found itself without the burden of this \ninstitutional duty. From this point of view the reform law of \nAugust 1991 is to be viewed very positively since it gave the \nagency precise goals. Nuclear energy was an enormous job that \nrequired commitment, involved great responsibility, care for the \nenvironment, and the development of advanced technologies. \n  Now my idea is to focus and gather the various initiatives \naround major projects, in a context that is easier to understand \nso that the objectives to be pursued are clearer. \n  The structural elements are still there. I mean to say, \nthere is still the expertise in the energy field, and the fields \nof related problems, from the rational use of energy, to the \nalternative sources, to nuclear energy and so on. \n  Prestipino: So is it a plan without an itinerary \nthat is to be reviewed as it goes along? \n  Cabibbo: Certainly. In the environmental field \nfor example, a central problem is that of working in harmony \nwith the others who are involved in this field. Let us not \nforget that there are about 3,000 researchers scattered around \nin various research centers working on the environment in Italy, \nand that about 800 of them are in ENEA. \n  Prestipino: Could ENEA have a role to play in \nthis harmonization process? \n  Cabibbo: In the environmental field work is also \ndone for projects. It is clear that ENEA will launch its own \nprojects, like the one on the Mediterranean Basin that was \npresented at the end of September at our marine research center \nat Santa Teresa. \n  Yes, in some ways we put ourselves forward as promoters and \ncoordinators, a little like we are for the Antarctic, but we are \nalways ready to compare what we are doing with what others are \ndoing. \n  Instead, that which ENEA can specifically provide and make \navailable to safeguard the environment, on the one hand is \nsystems ability, and on the other is technological ability. \nThese two riches permit ENEA to take on important roles, at a \nglobal level, in programs that do not take single aspects into \nconsideration, but that consider the environmental problems as a \nwhole, since they are necessarily interconnected and often \nrequire multidisciplinary interventions and collaboration with \nother countries. For example, Spain is very interested in \ncollaborating with us, and France, being very active in the \nenvironmental field, is already doing so. \n  Prestipino: Amongst the strategies for the \nrenewal of the agency, what effect will the new line that you \nannounced have on the use of the APE [Array Processor \nExperiment] super computer? \n  Cabibbo: The super computer is a central element \nfor the transfer of scientific knowledge to major applications, \nranging from those of the environment such as meteorology and \nclimatic changes, to those of great technological interest such \nas metallurgy and combustion processes. ENEA has ordered a \nlarge parallel computer capable of performing 100 billion \noperations per second, an APE Quadrics, produced by Alenia \nSpazio under license from the INFN. At present it is the most \npowerful parallel computer available in the world and the \ntechnology is entirely Italian. \n  We have also ordered six small Quadrics that will either be \nused for developing programs or for new types of applications, \nmade possible by the availability of the power of a super \ncomputer that has the size and advantages of a work station. \n  Prestipino: Will the super computer also be used \nin the energy sector? \n  Cabibbo: Certainly. For example, one of the \nproblems that we are carefully studying in the energy field is \nthat of combustion and this requires a combination of \nexperimental techniques and numerical simulation. The trend is \nto consider the experimental techniques as the validation of the \nsimulation techniques. The latter, in fact, are much richer, \nand permit a more detailed and careful study. ENEA has a very \nimportant experimental combustion center at Casaccia. We are \ntrying to integrate this experimental center, so that it forms \npart of a more complete picture that will involve the use, once \nthe Quadrics computer is available, of numerical simulation. \nThis will put us in the vanguard. \n  Prestipino: At this stage of renewal, while the \nstructure of the agency is being planned out on a grand scale, \nwhat would be a burden and what would be helpful? \n  Cabibbo: Compared to other agencies, ENEA is \ndivided into large research centers, such as those at Casaccia \nand Frascati near Rome, Saluggia in Piemonte, Trisaia in \nBasilicata, Brasimone in the Tuscan-Emilian Appenines, Portico \nin Campania, Santa Teresa in Liguria and Bologna. This \nstructure creates, on one hand, a managerial and organizational \nburden, but on the other it offers the advantage of being able \nto put an imposing striking force into the field to work on \nspecific problems that require the simultaneous use and synergy \nof various types of expertise. This is what ENEA has always \ndone in the past for the complex programs for nuclear power \nstations. \n  A very interesting program that has been recently managed by \nENEA has been the Antarctic Project. The agency was able to \npour its technical-scientific and managerial ability into this \nprogram. ENEA received merit for having enabled Italy to \npresent itself on the international scene in full dress. A \nmodern base was constructed in a short time and the quality of \nthe research programs carried out has allowed us to become one \nof the nations of the Antarctic Treaty with full rights, and to \ncollaborate, with equal scientific dignity, with the other \ncountries that are already present, such as the United States \nand France. But the Antarctic program is a paradigm from \nanother point of view in the sense that ENEA does not deal only \nwith those aspects that it finds more congenial, such as the \nsystems engineering and logistics that require extremely complex \noperations and the use of advanced technologies, but does so in \nclose collaboration with other research bodies. The scientific \nprogram is multidisciplinary, and ENEA, although it is also \npresent at this level, has a minor position with respect to the \nCNR [Italian National Research Council] and the universities \nthat play the major part. \n  Prestipino: What direction will the new ENEA \ntake, will it turn toward pure research or to a closer \ncollaboration with industry? \n  Cabibbo: It will pass through research, but also \nthrough its applications. ENEA is able to do valid research and \nas the institutional duties of ENEA also include direct \ninterventions, such as those on the environment, we are \ndirecting our work toward the concrete problems of the country. \nIn order for this to be possible and for it to give the results \nthat are wanted, the agency must have strong research components. \n  Prestipino: How is the agency preparing for its \nnew duties? How are the personnel and the engineers being \nretrained? \n  Cabibbo: Technical abilities are easily \ntransferable, particularly when you are working in complex \nsectors. For example, the director of the Antarctic program is \na nuclear engineer. New expertise is certainly necessary to \nenter new fields, but the possibility of self training is also \nto be valorized. \n  When we think about training we also think about it as a \nfurther field of service that ENEA could offer the national \ncommunity. \n  [Cabibbo continues] For example, today there is an extensive \nrequest for training that has arisen from local requirements for \nnew expertise, resulting from the necessity to look after \ncertain aspects of the safeguarding of the environment and to \nincrease energy saving. ENEA has a wealth of expertise to offer \nin these sectors. \n  Prestipino: In a certain sense the reform law has \nput ENEA on the market, pushing it to find its own funding for \nautonomous survival. How is it doing? \n  Cabibbo: I would say well. One third of the \nfunding is covered by collaboration programs with the ministries \nand with the European Community. It is enough to consider that, \nin terms of funding, international commissions entrusted to ENEA \namount to about 120 billion per year. \n  Prestipino: The south of Italy, what lines of \nintervention are planned for this area by ENEA? \n  Cabibbo: ENEA is moving toward the actuation of \nthe agreement on the Mezzogiorno [southern Italy] Program. For \nexample we have already taken on 55 of the projected 80 \nresearchers. At present we are waiting, but in the meantime we \nare working on a new collaboration agreement with the ministry \nof scientific research. \n  We are not so interested in the value of the initiative \nbeing \ndiscussed, as we are in its ends, the goals of such a \ncollaboration. \n  Prestipino: Energy. What is ENEA doing at an \ninternational level to have safe nuclear energy? \n  Cabibbo: Examining and reviewing current nuclear \ntechnologies following the referendum is of dramatic importance \nfor ENEA. \n  An interesting point is that our European partners, in \nparticular Germany, that were reluctant to accept the commitment \nto a new generation of reactors are now more disposed to do so. \nWork is being done on a new project at a European level. ENEA \nintends making its own contribution to this project, the EPR \n(European Pressurized Reactor), because it seems to meet our \nrequirements in terms of social acceptability. \n  The safety characteristics of new reactors can no longer be \nexpressed in terms of probabilities. The design must be such as \nto guarantee that even the biggest possible accident has no \nconsequences, either for the environment, or for the population. \n  The research for these new generation power stations must \ncontinue to lead to reactors that are intrinsically safe, with \nwhich, in the worst case, it would be possible to lose the \nreactor itself, but without emissions outside the plant that \nwere above the safety level. The construction of these plants, \nalready technologically possible, depends on a number of \nfactors, these being high costs, social acceptability, and the \nproblems of managing them. ENEA's research program is very \nlimited with respect to what the agency was doing in the \n'eighties, also because the new reactors require development and \ncertification at a European level, if not at a world level. \nThis is not a road that we can take alone. \n  Prestipino: Alternative forms of energy. Other \ncountries have moved on to their commercialization. In Italy we \nare still at the research stage. What does ENEA intend to do? \n  Cabibbo: The renewable sources that ENEA is \nconcerned with are wind energy and the energy that can be \nobtained from biomasses, such as garbage. They are already \ncompetitive, particularly if the social costs (pollution etc.) \nof the traditional sources of energy are taken into account. \nHowever, with respect to what is technologically possible \ntoday, Italy is behind as far as the use of energy derived from \nthe wind is concerned. \n  It is necessary to provide incentives for the construction \nand use of this type of equipment, as has been done in Denmark \nand the United Kingdom, guaranteeing those that use the \nequipment (usually small producers) that their energy will be \npurchased. ENEA has collaborated with two Italian industries in \nthe research and development for the construction of various \nmodels that are slightly different from those used in the \nnorthern European countries because of the lower wind speeds \nfound in our regions. Denmark and the United Kingdom are \ndemonstrating that already today it is possible to produce \nabundant energy from the wind, and to do so at competitive \nprices. \n  The time is also ripe for us to make the jump in quality \nfrom \nresearch to industrial application. It is one thing to \nconstruct a single prototype unit generating energy from the \nwind and it is another to construct a hundred, being able to \ncount on the economies of scale. \n  Prestipino: And solar energy? \n  Cabibbo: Solar energy is less conventional than \nwind energy. The energy produced by solar power plants has a \nhigher cost. It is an interesting technology for certain \nspecialized applications, such as isolated houses. However, it \nstill cannot make an impact on the energy consumption of the \ncountry. \n  Solar panels that are cheaper than those currently available \nare necessary if their use is to have a relevant impact. Once \nwe have gotten over this problem, the solution to which could be \nfound in the coming years, (ENEA is doing a lot of work in this \ndirection, both at the Portici center and in collaboration with \nother countries) the photovoltaic cell will become very \ndesirable, both for ecological motives, and from the aesthetic \npoint of view. Let us not forget that wind-powered generators \nhave been strongly contested in the United Kingdom because, \naccording to some environmentalists, the blades of the windmills \ndisfigure the countryside. \n  Prestipino: In conclusion, Prof. Cabibbo, where \nis ENEA going? How will it respond to the many older employees \nwho are retiring early? How will the agency be renewed? \n  Cabibbo: ENEA is still feeling the influence of \nnuclear energy, which required an organizational set-up that is \ntoo burdensome today. As an agency that dedicates itself to \nother activities it will be necessary to adjust the team. \n  The early retirements would be very positive if it were \npossible to bring young people into the agency. At present we \ncan only hire about 10 percent with respect to the number of \npeople who are leaving. An ideal turnover figure would be 20/30 \npercent. Without hiring young people, the agency is getting \nolder. Two thousand people will be leaving and it will be \nnecessary to hire at least 600 young people during the next 10 \nyears. "
FBIS3-42381,"After the completion of the Apollo moon \nprogram at the beginning of the 1970s, the U.S. National \nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department \nof Defense launched the design engineering of the Space Shuttle \nreusable space transport system (MTKS). The decision was made in \nthe USSR to create a transport system for analogous purposes in \norder to preserve parity, although the conceptual framework for \nair/space craft had begun to be developed here before the \nAmericans--since the beginning of the 1960s. \n<H6>  Space Shuttle </H6>\n  Crew. Two astronaut/pilots and up to five flight \nspecialists. \n  Composition. The Space Shuttle MTKS has an orbital \naircraft (OS), an external fuel tank (VTB) and two solid-fuel \nlaunch boosters (STU), sometimes called the first stage. The \nsole non-reusable element of the system is the VTB. \n  Flight configuration. The three propulsion ZhRDs \n[liquid-fuel rocket engines] of the OS and STU are ignited from \nthe moment of launch. The MTKS is launched vertically. The spent \nSTUs separate from the VTB and drop into the Atlantic Ocean by \nparachute. The OS continues flight using its own propulsion \nZhRDs, and after the fuel in the VTB is expended the tank \nseparates from the OS and burns up in the atmosphere. The \naircraft is brought into orbit using the ZhRD of the orbital \nmaneuvering system (SOM), which operates using storable \nhypergolic fuel. The MTKS is controlled on the injection section \nby rolling the propulsion ZhRDs in swivel suspensions and \ndeflecting the STU nozzles in an elastomeric (flexible) bearing. \nThe OS is controlled in orbit by the ZhRDs of the low-thrust \nrocket control system (RSU), which operates, like the SOM \nengines, using storable hypergolic fuel and is installed in the \nnose and in two rear sections. The OS, upon completion of \norbital operations, is slowed by the SOM engines, enters the \natmosphere and makes an aerodynamic controlled descent, a glide \nand a horizontal landing with inoperative engines. The RSU are \nused when leaving orbit and flying in the upper layers of the \natmosphere, and the aerodynamic control surfaces enter into \noperation to the extent of the descent of the OS. The crew \npilots the OS on the glide and landing legs. \n  Design. The wing is a low-mounted delta wing with \ndual sweep on the leading edge, split ailerons on the trailing \nedge and without any means of mechanization. The fuselage is a \nsemimonocoque design with flat sides. It consists of three \nparts--the nose holds a two-level airtight cockpit for the crew \nand a compartment for the electronics gear, the middle has a \nnon-airtight cargo bay (OPN), under which runs the central \ntorsion box of the wing, and in the rear is the compartment for \nthe main engine installation (ODU), the SOM nacelles and the \nswept tail with a split rudder. The lower portion of the rear \ntail section has a balancing flap under the fuselage, which \nplays the role of an air brake along with the rudder during \nlanding. The airframe was constructed principally of aluminum \nalloys. The doors of the OPN and the fairing of the SOM nacelles \nare manufactured of graphite-epoxy composite materials (KM); the \nstrength elements of the tail fin are made of boron-aluminum KM, \nand the seating frame for the main ZhRDs of boron- epoxy KM; the \nhousing of the high-pressure tanks and some of the trunk lines \nare made of Kevlar-epoxy resin type organic fibers. \n  Thermal protection of OS is passive, and covers \nalmost the entire surface of the craft. The most heat-stressed \nlocations on the OS--the tips of the fuselage and the wing--are \ncovered with reinforced carbon-carbon type KM, followed by \nplates of silicon dioxide with a boron-silicate coating with \nheat-resistant additives that are black in color protecting the \nlower surfaces of the fuselage and the wing, as well as its tips \nand trailing edge. White plates of silicon dioxide fibers with a \nboron-silicate coating are installed on the upper surfaces of \nthe wing and fuselage, the tail fin and the SOM nacelles. The \nleast heat-stressed locations--the OPN doors, upper surface of \nthe wing and sides of the fuselage and SOM nacelles--are \nprotected with mats of nylon fiber covered with an organic \nsilicon resin. \n  Engine installations. The main engine installation \nconsists of three SSME oxygen-hydrogen propulsion ZhRDs from the \nfirm of Rocketdyne, with a thrust of 170 tones of force each on \nEarth or 213 tons in a vacuum. The engines have a self-contained \nconfiguration (both components enter the combustion chamber in \ngaseous form), with the reheating of spent turbogas in \nhigh-pressure combustion chambers, installed on the OS and fed \nfrom the VTB. The two solid-fuel launch boosters from the firm \nof Morton-Thiokol mounted along the sides of the VTB have a \nthrust of 1,203 tons of force at sea level. \n  The power plant of the OS consists of three batteries of \nhydrogen-oxygen fuel elements and three hydrazine auxiliary \npower plants used to steer the main ZhRDs, as well as to control \nthe aerodynamic surfaces and the landing gear. \n  Status. The Space Shuttle MTKS had made 53 flights \nas of January 1993. Six OS were built--the Enterprise (employed \nas an analogue of the OS for horizontal flight testing), the \nColumbia, the Challenger (lost in the catastrophe of January \n1986), the Atlantis, the Discovery and the Endeavour. The system \ncontinues to be in service. \n  Additional information. The existing configuration \nof the MTKS was chosen in 1974. The flight testing started in \nApril of 1981. \n  The MTKS is currently employed for deliveries to space, \nsupporting astronauts in orbit and returning especially valuable \npayloads to Earth, but the Department of Defense had decided by \nthe end of 1992 to refrain from the use of the MTKS to put \nmilitary payloads into orbit, and to use the non-reusable launch \nvehicles of the Titan family for this purpose. \n<H6>  Energiya/Buran </H6>\n  Crew. Two to four cosmonaut/pilots and up to six \nflight specialists. \n  Composition. The Energiya/Buran MTKS includes the \nEnergiya launch vehicle (four Zenit-1 launch boosters and a \ncentral second-stage unit), which is able to put various \npayloads and the Buran orbital vessel (OK) into orbit. The OK \nand the launch boosters are the reusable elements of the system. \n  Flight configuration. At the moment of launch the \nMTKS includes the four RD-0120 oxygen-hydrogen engines of the \ncentral unit and the four RD-170 oxygen-kerosene engines of the \nboosters. Launch is vertical. The boosters separate from the \ncentral unit after finishing their operation, make a parachute \ndescent in the atmosphere and land. The central unit ceases \noperation before reaching the nominal orbit, separates from the \nOK and is destroyed on entering the dense layers of the \natmosphere. The OK is brought up to orbit using two \noxygen-kerosene ZhRDs of the SOM system. The MTKS is controlled \nduring this ascent stage by steering the combustion chambers of \nthe ZhRDs in the central unit and the boosters on their bearing \nsuspensions. Low-thrust oxygen- kerosene ZhRDs mounted in the \nnose and two in the rear RSU units control the OK in orbit. \nAfter the completion of orbital operations, the SOM engine \nissues a braking impulse, and the OK enters the atmosphere, \nmakes an aerodynamic controlled descent, glides and make a \nhorizontal landing with non-operating engines. The RSUs are used \nwhen leaving orbit and in the upper layers of the atmosphere, \nwith the aerodynamic control surfaces coming into action to the \nextent of the descent of the OK. The OK can be controlled on the \nglide and landing legs either by the crew or automatically. \n  Design of the OK. The Buran is in principle \nanalogous to the OS of the Space Shuttle by and large, but its \nwing is shifted forward somewhat. The tail section of the \nfuselage, aside from the rudder and flap under the fuselage, has \nthe SOM engine installation, RSU units and a pod with the \nbraking parachute. \n  Thermal protection of the OK is passive and \nplated. The tips of the fuselage and wing are covered with a \ncarbon-carbon type reinforced KM, with the less heat-stressed \nplaces having plates of sintered quartz fiber with a protective \ncoating. The thermal protection of the Buran OK, as opposed to \nthe American craft, is all-weather--it can withstand rain and \nhail. \n  Engine installations. The principal ZhRDs of the \nlaunch vehicle and the ship are executed in a self-contained \nconfiguration (hydrogen comes into the combustion chamber in \ngaseous form, and the oxygen in liquid form) with the reheating \nof spent turbogas in the combustion chambers under high \npressure. The RD-170 engines have a thrust of 740 tonnes of \nforce each, the RD-0120s 156 tonnes each (205 in a vacuum) and \nthe SOM ZhRDs 8,500 tonnes in a vacuum. \n  The power plant of the Buran OK is analogous to that of the \nSpace Shuttle OS. \n  Status. The Energiya launch vehicle has made two \nflights--15 May 1987 with a Skif-DM (Polyus) module as the \npayload, and 15 November 1988 with the Buran OK without \ncosmonauts. The OK No. 1 had been mothballed by the start of \n1993, with the OK No. 2 prepared for orbital flight; the \nmanufacture of OK No. 3 has been curtailed. \n  Additional information. The decree on the \ndevelopment of the Energiya/Buran MTKS came out in February 1976 \nafter the cancellation of the N1-L3 program. The manufacture of \nfive Buran OKs had been proposed. The MTKS was to meet the \ncountry's needs for the placement into orbit of medium and heavy \npayloads for civilian and military purposes, with the return of \nsome of them to Earth. \n  A special version of the VM-T bomber, which provided for the \nseparate transport of the launch vehicle and the OK on an \nexternal hanger over the aircraft fuselage, was created in order \nto transport the larger elements of the system from the \nmanufacturing plant to the engineering positions. The An-225 \nMriya heavy-lift transport aircraft was later created for these \nsame purposes. \n  Smaller models of the OK (the BOR-4 and BOR-5) launched \nusing \nthe Kosmos launch vehicle were used to try out the aerodynamics \nand thermal protection of the craft in the range of high \nhypersonic speeds. \n  Flight testing of the Energiya/Buran has been halted, owing \nto the cutbacks in appropriations and the loss of interest in \nthe program on the part of the Ministry of Defense. A \nnon-piloted flight of Buran OK No. 2 is being proposed for 1993, \nwith the subsequent mothballing of all of the MTKSs until such \ntime as spheres for its efficient utilization are found. \n\n"
FBIS3-42460,"Having studied the properties of water, S. Benson \nand E. \nSiebert (University of Southern California at Los Angeles) have \narrived at the conclusion that the molecules of this liquid do \nnot jostle randomly, but form short-lived networks in the shape \nof cubes of eight molecules and rings of four molecules. The \ncubes and rings are then formed into chains and networks. \n  Experimental data obtained for the hard and gas phases were \nused to construct a theoretical model of water in the liquid \nphase. The chemists claim that the microstructures they \ndiscovered help explain some of the unusual properties of water, \nsuch as its ability to absorb large amounts of heat and its \nability to expand on freezing. \n  Most liquids fall into one of two categories: they are \neither \nregular or structured. The molecules in regular liquids form \nrelatively weak bonds in pairs under the impact of van der Waals \nforces. Because these forces do not have a particular direction, \nthe molecules are free to adopt any orientation relative to one \nanother to fill free space. The organic solvent \ntetrachloromethane is an example of such a liquid. Such liquids, \nthe molecules of which are held together by stronger, oriented \nforces, are among the regular liquids. Usually, these are \nhydrogen bonds, which form between a slightly positive hydrogen \natom in one molecule and an oxygen atom with a weak negative \ncharge in a neighboring molecule. \n  Structured liquids cannot be described by the simple \nempirical formulas that are used to describe the physical \nproperties of regular liquids. For example, each molecule in a \nregular liquid with closely packed molecules can be surrounded \nby 10-11 others. In a structured liquid, there can be as few as \n4-5 of these molecules and therefore sufficient free space \nremains between molecules. \n  The American scientists think that water is possibly the \nmost \nextreme representative of a structured liquid. It has maximum \ndensity at a temperature of 4ëC and an unexpectedly high \nheat capacity. After many years of debates, scientists arrived \nat the conclusion that hydrogen bonds are the cause of the \nanomalous properties of water, however, there is still no \nadequate theory that precisely predicts water's heat capacity \nand fluidity or explains such a property of water as its low \ndensity in solid state. \n  Benson and Siebert claim that with their new \noctamer-tetramer \nmodel of intermolecular hydrogen bonds permits them to predict \nthe physical characteristics of water in the entire range of \ntemperatures of the existence of the liquid phase (from 0 to \n100ëC) with an accuracy of up to 2% with regard to \nexperimental data. \n  The scientists do not claim that water consists exclusively \nof cubic and ring bonds of molecules, but they think that these \nare the simplest and most widespread types of bonds. Instruments \ndo not yet exist that permit us to record such formations \nbecause the hydrogen bonds between water molecules form and \nbreak with a frequency of 500 Ghz. \n  Benson and Siebert say that water might also contain other \nstructures--such as cyclic pentamers (five molecules in a ring) \nor decameric sandwich dimers. But they also admit that there is \nno evidence of the existence of these microstructures, except \nfor calculations of thermal and volumetric properties which \nmatch experimental data. \n  The proposed microstructural theory also explains water's \nanomalous behavior when other substances are added. Although the \npresence of simple hydrogen bonds predicts that a polar \nsubstance such as ammonia gives off heat when it dissolves in \nwater, it cannot explain why this occurs even when nonpolar \ntetrachloromethane dissolves. \n  NEW SCIENTIST, 25 July 1992, Vol. 135, No. 1831, p. \n14. \n<H5>  Berlin Builds a Second Synchrotron </H5>\n  The Federal Ministry of Research and Technology (Germany) \nhas \nannounced the construction of a second synchrotron, BESSY-II, in \nBerlin-Allershof in addition to BESSY-I located in West Berlin. \n  BESSY-II is primarily designed for basic research and will \nhave a ring with a diameter three times as large as BESSY-I's, \nwhich will permit the production of a magnetic field with \napproximately 1,000-10,000 times greater voltage. \n  Construction of the new synchrotron will cost 190 million \nDeutsche marks (&pound;68.5 million).

FBIS3-42749,"Vitaliy Mikhaylovich, the subject of our \ndiscussion is the present and probable future of Moldovan energy \nengineering. But first--about the conflict between you and the \ninstitute's scientific council, which has been given \nunjustifiably broad publicity. You are accused of abuse of \npower, protectionism, incorrect use of funds allotted to the \ninstitute, and other sins. With the exception of the one article \nin MOLODEZH MOLDOVY, from the other publications the readers \nreceived essentially one-sided information about the essence of \nthe conflict. And your silence in this situation seems somewhat \nstrange. \n  [Postolatiy] I admit that among the accusations that have \nbeen hurled at me there are some that are fair. But in the flow \nof fabrications, squabbles, and fact juggling they make up too \nsmall a part to cause us to believe that my opponents are really \nconcerned about affairs of the institute and the development of \nenergy engineering in Moldova. \n  I have nothing against sweeping the garbage out of the hut \nand placing it in the garbage can. But my colleagues and \nsubordinates have spread it out in the street for everyone to \nsee, brought in garbage from the outside, and they shout: Look \nat how neat and clean we are! It seemed to me that my \ndifferences with that part of them, namely the part of the \nscholarly council, was a matter for within the institute. \nTherefore, if you will, out of delicacy I did not make a \nstatement in response. Then, when the mass attack against me was \nturned into a witch hunt it was not easy to find a publication \nthat would publish the arguments of the other side in spite of \nthe relatively well-developed public opinion. \n  [Valentik] Well, you have found such a publication. So what \nis the essence of the conflict? \n  [Postolatiy] Last year the Ministry of the National Economy \nallotted us less money than was anticipated. I raised the \nquestion of its distribution at the scholarly council of the \ninstitute, which on 5 May adopted a decision regarding this \nissue. In particular, it decided to freeze certain work under \nthe state order. And the job of dealing with the workers \ndischarged in this was magnanimously assigned to the director. \nThere was only one solution: to reduce the number of workers by \n25-30 percent. But for our recently created institute it would \nbe a great mistake to lose skilled personnel even in such an \nextreme situation. The general meeting of institute workers \nconvened on my initiative arrived at the same opinion. Moreover, \nnote, there was not a single objection. They started pouring \ndown when on 31 May I issued an order for redistribution of \nbudget funds taking the real situation into account. Certain \nmembers of the scholarly council regarded this as the director's \ndisrespect for the decision they had adopted previously and they \ndeclared war on me. \n  [Valentik] So first the scholarly council decided to reveal \nthe truth by a majority of votes and then they decided to \nclarify it by an even larger majority. \n  [Postolatiy] I set a more modest task for myself--to \npreserve \nthe collective and fulfill the plan for scientific research work \nas completely as possible. \n  [Valentik] As I understand it, the council is created in \norder to advise the director, and not to make decisions for him. \nYou are the leader but, excuse me, not God's dandelion blown by \nthe breath of others' opinions. Were you not motivated by a \ndesire to share with the council the responsibility for the \ninstitute's affairs. \n  [Postolatiy] Whatever the advice from the scholarly council \nmay be, the responsibility is placed squarely on the shoulders \nof the director. In this case I did not want to make a decision \nthat was not in keeping with the interests of the matter. After \nthat it went like this...the Ministry of Economics granted us \nthe right to change the volume of work. As a result of \nadjustments that were made the financial situation in the \ninstitute improved somewhat. Moreover, in conjunction with the \nscholarly council, we managed to decide the fate of the workers \nwho had been left without wages. Now it was possible to adopt \nthe council's previous recommendations of 5 May. I made this \ncompromise for the sake of the cause. But not all the members of \nthe scholarly council were satisfied with this outcome of the \nmatter. As they say, give them an inch and they will take a \nmile. And they began an even more vicious attack on the \ndirector. August and September were a time when the institute \nwas overwhelmed with full inspections. Defamatory statements, \nanonymous letters, and other charming things like this came \npouring in. But not a single proposal about improving the \ninstitute's work was received from our opponents. There followed \na resolution according to which the laboratory headed by the \ndirector was left essentially without funds. \n  [Valentik] In that case you could sooner be accused of \ninability to wield power than abuse of it. As far as I know, \neven your irreconcilable enemies are not accusing you of \nincompetence or of violating the law either. The presidium of \nthe Academy of Sciences considered you worthy of heading the \ninstitute in the future. And you probably cannot be held to \nblame for the thoughtlessness of members of the presidium. Why \nare your opponents still unable to make peace? What are they \ntrying to achieve? \n  [Postolatiy] Some of them want anyone at all to be the \ndirector as long as it is not me. \n  [Valentik] But since you are the director, let us get down \nto \nbusiness. In my view, something strange is happening with \nMoldova's energy potential now. The republic ships in almost all \nits fuel (98 percent) from other countries. It ships in less \neach year: in 1991--13 million tonnes of conventional fuel, in \n1992--11.6 million. The output of electric energy is dropping \ncorrespondingly: from 13.2 billion kilowatt-hours in 1991 to \n11.1 billion in 1992. In 1990 we produced 16 billion \nkilowatt-hours of electric energy. It was sufficient, but no \nmore than that. Now the deficit is being felt in all spheres of \nthe republic's life. The population has been deprived of hot \nwater. The heating batteries are not heated to their full \ncapacity. In order to avoid paying outrageous prices for \nelectric energy, pensioners use stearine candles. Yet Moldova \nexports electric energy abroad. Particularly to Romania and \nBulgaria. \n  [Postolatiy] Our institute has nothing to do with the \nredistribution of fuel and electric energy. But do not forget \nthat commercial structures now have the right to purchase energy \nsources and produce energy from them. They use some of it at \ntheir own discretion. As for the state sector, here the \nsituation is different: Because of the sharp decline in \nproduction a kind of reserve of energy capacity has been created. \n  [Valentik] So perhaps my colleague from the newspaper TSARA \nis right when, referring to the opinion of experts, he writes \nthat If we had an energy system with high-voltage lines in the \ncountries of Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Turkey) we could export \nelectric energy at advantageous prices and at the same time \nobtain a profit of approximately $50-70 million. \n  [Postolatiy] In the first place, as one can see from his \narticle, your colleague is confusing kilowatts with kilovolts; \nin the second place, apparently, he met his match in the \nexperts. If you build a high-voltage transmission line, the \nimmediate reason for doing so lies not in Turkey or Bulgaria, \nbut in Moldova--with the prospect of entering the unified \nEuropean energy system. As for the reserves of electric energy \nthat have now been formed, this is a temporary, ephemeral \nphenomenon. The predictions of real specialists tell us that the \nconsumption of fuel and energy resources by 1995 in our country \nwill reach the 1990 level and will grow in accordance with the \nincrease in production volumes. Here it is necessary to take \ninto account that the proportional expenditure of energy \nresources on the manufacture of a unit of output in our country \nexceeds world indicators by 1.5-2 times. And our industry can \nhardly count on utilizing advanced energy-saving \ntechnologies--at least in the next decade. \n  The situation now is such that our energy sector is being \nfinished off as they try to skim of the good parts. And this is \nat a time when 44 percent of the republic's energy equipment has \noutlived its service life and needs to be replaced. We are \nburning our fixed capital, which is in need of modernization \nand development, for the sake of momentary advantage. \n  We have an immense deficit in the financing of energy \ndeliveries. The handling capacity of the republic's external \nelectrical communications with our neighbors, especially \nRomania, is clearly inadequate. The schedule for loading in the \nenergy system is not uniform--the fluctuations reach 30-40 \npercent of the maximum. In the next few years the situation \ncould develop in such a way that energy engineering in Moldova \nwill not be in a condition to provide the economy with \nelectricity and heat in a balanced way. And they are talking to \nus about tens of millions in profit for exported electric energy! \n  The basis of the strategic development of energy engineering \nis the provision of a self-balance of electric and thermal \ncapacities. Calculations show that it will always be more \nadvantageous to buy fuel resources than to import pure energy. \nThis means that the development of generating capacities must \nbecome one of the most important areas in the development of \nenergy engineering. \n  [Valentik] In such an alarming situation, why are the funds \nreceived from the sale of electric energy abroad by the state \nsector not invested in the development of the republic's energy \nengineering? That would be only fair. \n  [Postolatiy] That is necessary. But that question is not for \nme but for the republic government. \n  [Valentik] Let us say that I asked it of the government. \nVitaliy Mikhaylovich, the demand: Give us what we need--today! \nis the curse of all basic sciences. Your science, perhaps more \nthan others, can be regarded as an applied science. What can \nyour Institute do for Moldovan energy engineering today? \n  [Postolatiy] Practical return is very important. But without \nbasic research we would have nothing to give. The work of all 11 \nof the institute's laboratories encompasses problems of energy \nengineering almost to a maximum. They include modelling the \ndevelopment of energy systems and conditions for their \noperation; reliability of energy supply; controlled electricity \ndistribution; microprocessor control systems; diagnostics of \nenergy equipment; electro-physics and high voltage technology; \ncontrolled electric energy accumulators; economics, energy \nsaving, automation, the application of computer equipment, etc. \n  Along with other organizations we have drawn up a draft \nprogram for the development of energy engineering of Moldova up \nto the year 2010 and submitted it to the republic government. \nSpeaking on the whole, the main direction of the institute's \nactivity is to increase the effectiveness of energy systems and \nenergy supply systems. \n  [Valentik] It is known that you assign a significant role in \nthe development of Moldovan energy engineering to extensive \nintroduction of USVL (controlled self-compensating high voltage \nelectric power transmission lines) and varieties of them--SVL \n[self-compensating high voltage power transmission lines] and \nVLSF [expansion not identified]. But some members of your \ninstitute's scholarly council have their doubts about the \neffectiveness of these lines and certain specialists from \nsimilar departments think that their introduction into practice \nis unpromising. Essentially the same conclusion was reached by \nthe commission of the republic's Academy of Sciences. \n  [Postolatiy] At the beginning of our discussion you \ncorrectly \nnoted that it is impossible to establish the truth by a majority \nof votes. So I am convinced that the USVL and varieties of it \nare the immediate future for Moldovan energy engineering, and \nnot just Moldovan. This is also shown by experience with their \npractical utilization. \n  It would take us 10 years to convince specialists that, \nparticularly with respect to power transmission lines with a \nvoltage of 10 kilovolts, it would be possible to place \nhigh-voltage supports every 90-100 meters instead of 60-70. Now \nwe will probably have to--God forbid that this will take 10 \nyears too--convince many of my colleagues of the need to use \nUSVL. And yet these lines provide for considerably greater \nreliability of electric power supply. Their application reduces \nthe number of power failures by 30 percent, it reduces \nexpenditures on servicing, transmission, and distribution of \nelectric energy, it reduces losses of it by 2-4 percent, it \nincreases the handling capacity by 15-40 percent, and it \nsignificantly reduces the impact on the environment. \n  Among the opponents of the USVL are specialists--true, not \nmany of them--who simply cannot understand that the future lies \nwith these lines. That is, because of certain considerations \nthey do not want to understand. I am prepared to discuss all \nissues with them under the condition that they not be guided by \na desire to prove that they are right by any means but \nexclusively by the interests of the matter. \n  [Valentik] Apparently the World Bank will grant Moldova \ncredit in the amount of $30 million for the development of \nenergy engineering with a rate of 7.5 percent. How, in your \nview, should this money be used? \n  [Postolatiy] For transportation for the delivery of fuel and \nfor storage facilities. This will be recouped 100-fold. For \nincreasing the effectiveness of the processing and utilization \nof fuel. To do this it is necessary to update and reconstruct \nequipment. For reinforcement of energy ties with our neighbors, \nthat is, the construction of high-voltage power transmission \nlines that link us to energy systems of Russia, Ukraine, \nRomania, Bulgaria, etc. For reinforcement of connections among \nenergy systems inside the republic. \n  Russia is proposing a joint project for the assimilation of \nthe Yamal gas deposit and the deposits of Western Siberia. I \nthink that it is simply necessary for Moldova to participate in \nthem. Along with this it is necessary to study the possibility \nof obtaining fuel resources from other countries. \n  [Valentik] We shall hope that we will not spread out the \nAmerican credit among the various ministries and departments \nand...well, I wish success to your institute and to you, its \nleader.

The report urges deregulation to eliminate \nprice differences and to realize Japan's full growth potential. \nAlso, in an article published on 24 December, Seiji Shimpo, a \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) economist, urges deregulation so that \nJapan can harmonize its economy with the world economy if it is to \nsurvive. \n\n   To analyze the difference between Japanese and U.S. consumer \nprices, the DRI surveyed the prices of 23 items in various \nindustrial categories in both countries between August and November \n1993, according to a DRI report published in the 18 December issue \nof SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI, a leading business weekly.  At an exchange \nrate of 107 yen to the dollar, Japanese prices are from 1.1 to 2.0 \ntimes higher than U.S. prices.  Even using the 1992 OECD purchasing \npower rate of 190 yen to the dollar, Japanese prices are 0.6 to 1.5 \ntimes higher than U.S  prices. \n\n   Based on the survey, the DRI calculated parity exchange rates \nfor each of the 23 items.  They range from 1,180 yen to $1 for \nwheat, 700 yen per $1 for gasoline, 540 yen for butter, 290 yen for \nlong-distance telephone calls and electricity, 135 yen for \nautomobiles, 120 yen for audio-visual equipment, and 50 yen for \npharmaceutical products sold to hospitals. \n\n   Big Price Disparities Due to Productivity Differences -- The DRI \nreport points out that price differences among Japanese goods and \nservices caused by differences in productivity are far greater \nthan differences between foreign and domestic prices, which are \nmainly caused by a strong yen that does not reflect actual \npurchasing power.  Those items whose Japanese prices are higher \nthan U.S. prices, based on either the current yen to dollar rate \n(107:1) or the OECD's 190:1 rate, or the purchasing power rate \nare foodstuffs, petroleum products, public utilities, housing, \napparel, and polyethylene, products which are for the most part are \nregulated by the government and whose productivity is low. \n\n   In the case of automobiles, audio-visual equipment, ethylene, \nsteel, copper, high-quality paper, and oil tankers, whose production \nis not regulated by the government and which are manufactured in \nhighly productive processes, Japanese prices are still slightly \nhigher based on the current exchange rate, but would be lower based \non a purchasing power rate. \n\n   According to the report, pharmaceutical products sold to \nhospitals are the only items whose prices are remarkably lower \nbased on either the current or purchasing power rate.  The report \nnotes, however, that since Japanese doctors and hospitals tend to \nprescribe excessive quantities of drugs, consumers end up paying \nmuch money for drugs. \n\n   Prices Remain High Even Though Yen Has Appreciated -- Concerning \nmanufactured and processed goods other than dairy products, \ntextiles, color television sets, and semiconductors, domestic prices \nhave not come down even though the yen started appreciating in 1985. \nThe primary reason, according to the DRI report, is that Japanese \nimports have not increased sufficiently to cause domestic prices to \ndrop.  The report explains that government regulations, standards \nand certification systems, and a variety of Japanese business \npractices work to prevent foreign products, whose prices have \ndropped due to the strong yen, from gaining market share in Japan. \nThe report argues that because of such barriers, the commonly \nunderstood logic that yen appreciation will lead to increased \nimports, which in turn will promote competition in the Japanese \nmarket, increase Japanese productivity, and lower prices, does not \nwork in Japan. \n\n   Concerning services, such as public utilities, distribution, and \npersonal services, the report adds that Japanese prices have \nremained basically the same regardless of the exchange rate, because \nthe exchange rate does not affect competitive conditions in these \nindustries. \n\n   Deregulation Urged To Realize Full Growth Potential -- The report \nurges deregulation measures be adopted by the government to raise \nproductivity in protected industries and eliminate price \ndifferences.  The report claims that the automobile and electronics \nindustries, which have led Japan's exports and contributed to its \neconomic growth, are not regulated and therefore have achieved high \nproductivity and international competitiveness in the face of \nsevere competition.  In the public utilities, communications, \nfood, and petroleum industries, on the other hand, protection by \ngovernment regulations has kept both productivity and \ncompetitiveness low. \n\n   The DRI concludes that when the government deregulates the \nprotected industries to raise their productivity to U.S. levels, \nJapan's gross domestic product (GDP) would be 10 percent, or 45 \ntrillion yen ($421 billion), higher than if no deregulation occurs \nin the next 10 years.  It also notes that when productivity is \nraised by deregulation, approximately 6.4 million workers, or about \n10 percent of the total labor force, will become surplus. \n\n   MOF Economist Urges Deregulation To Help Japan's Economic \nRecovery -- In an article published in the 24 December NIHON KEIZAI \nSHIMBUN (NIKKEI), Seiji Shimpo, deputy director of Ministry of \nFinance's (MOF) Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, argues that \nJapan should implement deregulation for two basic reasons: 1) \nJapan's system must be compatible with those of other \nindustrialized countries; and 2) Japan needs to expand opportunities \nfor new businesses to escape the current recession.  Shimpo notes \nthat contrary to the international trend toward deregulation \nfollowing the collapse of the planned economies, the number of \nregulations has been increasing in Japan.  In 1987, for example, \n40.1 percent of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) was produced by \nindustries that are regulated to some extent, and 21.8 percent of \nGDP was produced by industries that are tightly regulated.  In \n1989, these percentages increased to 40.8 percent and 24.1 percent \nrespectively. \n\n   In addition to intense lobbying by interest groups, Shimpo points \nout that the value Japanese place on coexistence and harmony is \nan obstacle to deregulation.  Shimpo rejects the Federation of \nEconomic Organizations' (Keidanren) policy of coexistence (kyosei) \nby asking why consumers want inefficient firms and incompetent \nmanagers to coexist.  Shimpo notes that the government, Keidanren, \nand even the media have a perception that government guidance and \nthe observance of guidance by industry are ethical.  In the same \nvein, order and mutual assistance among companies in an industry \nare virtues.  Shimpo asserts that all this contradicts the \nprinciple of competition upon which market capitalism is founded. \nThe Japanese people should remember, he observes, that the basic \nfactor generating economic development in Japan has been market \ncompetition, not government regulation. \n\n   Shimpo is critical of Japan's media for tending to report \neconomic issues in a manner that appeals to the heart rather than \nthe mind of readers.  This helps the so-called revisionists in \nthe United States justify their calls for discrimination against \nJapan in international trade by highlighting alleged differences \nbetween Japan and the other industrialized nations.  Shimpo asserts \nthat it is Japan's responsibility to prove that the revisionists \nare wrong by reforming Japan's economic society. \n   In conclusion, Shimpo restates his view that deregulation is an \nunavoidable step in harmonizing the Japanese economy with the world \neconomy, from which Japan cannot be isolated if it is to survive. \nHe urges politicians to institutionalize the economic logic and \nanalyses of deregulation that have been recommended by economists. \n\n   MOF Makes It Easier for Consumers To Monitor Prices of Imported \nGoods -- As part of the Hosokawa cabinet's policy of sharing the \nbenefits of the current strong yen with consumers, the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) published in the November issue of FINANCE, the \nministry's monthly journal, a report on the custom clearance prices \nof 30 consumer products imported in September 1993.  The MOF \nselected 30 consumer goods which it considers of the highest \ninterest to consumers and, for the first time, published their \nprices separately from the detailed custom clearance data appearing \nin its monthly trade statistics. \n\n   According to the report, the import prices for 25 of the 30 \nproducts dropped compared to September 1992, ranging from a 43- \npercent drop in the price of bananas, a 38.7-percent decline in the \nprice of Italian dress shirts, a 5.6-percent drop for U.S. \ncigarettes, and a 4.5-percent drop for Scotch whisky.  The weighted \naverage of the 30 custom clearance prices dropped 14.8 percent \ncompared to September 1992.  The report concludes that the primary \ncause for the drop in import prices is the appreciation of the yen, \nwhich has appreciated by 16.1 percent, from 124 yen per dollar in \nSeptember 1992 to 104 in September 1993.  The report notes that some \nof the goods were paid for in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. \nFor example, English tea was priced in British pounds, which \ndepreciated about 30 percent against the yen, and Italian dress \nshirts were priced in Italian lira, which depreciated about 42 \npercent against the yen.  Some goods were contracted for in yen, \nsuch as frozen tuna, American beer and cigarettes, and German \nautomobiles, and their import prices were not affected by the \nforeign exchange rate. \n\n   The MOF report also contains Tokyo retail prices compiled by the \nEconomic Planning Agency (EPA) as of October 1993 for 20 of the 30 \nimported consumer goods.  The MOF claims that by comparing retail \nprices continuously, everyone will see the extent to which the \nbenefits of a strong yen are distributed.  The MOF urges consumers \nto strictly monitor trends in import and retail prices. \n\n   According to the EPA data contained in the MOF report, the Tokyo \nretail prices of the 20 imported products rarely reflect the \ndecreases in import prices.  For example, the custom clearance price \nof Italian spaghetti dropped 35.7 percent, while the retail price \ndropped only 4.1 percent, and the custom clearance price of U.S. \ngolf balls dropped 10.3 percent, but the retail price rose 1.0 \npercent.  Of 16 imported consumer goods whose custom clearance \nprices had fallen, the retail prices of 13 goods dropped; two (U.S. \nbeer and U.S. cigarettes) remained the same; and one (U.S. golf \nballs) rose.  Of the four products whose custom clearance prices had \nrisen, the retail prices of two (oranges and tennis rackets) \ndropped, while two (EC-made electric shavers and lemons) rose. \n\n   Environmental Issues:  STA To Begin Underwater Cable Project To \nTrack Seismic Activity -- The Science and Technology Agency (STA) \nthis year will begin a 10-year project to lay an underwater fiber \noptic cable, fitted with seismometers, around the Japanese \narchipelago as part of a comprehensive marine environmental \nobservation network to track and monitor undersea seismic activity. \nBasically the STA will use the fiber optic network in place of \nobservation vessels and submarines to detect earthquakes and tidal \nwaves and to provide timely, detailed information on their scale and \npotential impact.  The STA also hopes to attach other sensors to the \nfiber optic cable to measure underwater temperatures, ocean \ncurrents, and earth plate and volcanic activity, as well as to \ncollect data on the levels of carbon dioxide in sea water for \nresearch on global warming.  The research results gained from the \nproject will also be used to develop technology for using the \noptical fiber itself as a type of thermometer. \n\n   Twenty public and private enterprises will participate in the STA \nproject, including research organizations of the Ministry of \nInternational Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Transport, \nTokyo University, NEC, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Oki Electric \nIndustry.  The STA will spend the first five years of the project \ndeveloping the basic technology related to the seismometers and \ndeveloping methods to transmit the data.  Then the agency will begin \nlaying the fiber optic cable off the Japanese islands and later at \ndeeper levels, closer to submarine trenches.  (Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI \nSHIMBUN 4 Jan 94 p 1) \n\n   KEPCO, TEPCO To Provide Environmental Know-how To India -- Kansai \nElectric Power Co. (KEPCO) and Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) will \nprovide environmental technology and know-how to the nine thermal \npower plants in India with a total generating capacity of 18.2 \nmillion kilowatts. The two companies will work with the public \nthermal power companies which manage the plants as part of an \nagreement reached at a 1992 meeting of power company executives from \nthroughout the world. \n\n   KEPCO will transfer its environmental technology and plant \nmanagement know-how to control sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide \nemissions.  TEPCO will provide guidance on improving the fuel \nefficiency of boilers to reduce the amount of coal consumed, and \nalso will instruct the companies on reducing and controlling the \nvolume of gas emissions from their thermal power plants.  (Tokyo \nNIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 4 Jan 94 p 11) \n\n   Financial Issues:  FEATURE:  Japanese Banks Have 'Asia Fever' -- \nSUMMARY:  According to the Japanese press, Japanese banks are making \na special effort to penetrate financial markets in Thailand, \nMalaysia, and China. \n\n   The 7 December MAINICHI SHIMBUN reports that presently there are \n18 Japanese banks in Thailand, including six that opened branches in \nBangkok in 1993--Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), Long-Term Credit \nBank of Japan (LTCB), Sumitomo Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Dai-Ichi \nKangyo Bank (DKB), and Sanwa Bank--and two that established \nrepresentative offices there in 1993, Bank of Fukuoka and Sumitomo \nTrust Bank.  The banks are reportedly responding to the Thai \ngovernment's financial liberalization policy and promotion of \noffshore markets.  According to one Japanese branch manager in \nThailand, the rate of profit at Thai branches is first or second \namong our branches worldwide.  The banks say that their objective \nin going into Thailand is to supply Japanese companies with funds to \nexpand their operations there. \n\n   Meanwhile in Malaysia, according to the MAINICHI, Japanese banks \nare participating in creating an international financial center \n(kokusai kinyu center) on Labuan Island, an offshore market located \nin the north of Borneo.  DKB and Sanwa opened branches there in \nNovember 1993 while IBJ and Sakura were scheduled to follow suit in \nDecember. \n\n   In addition, the 17 January NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN reports that the \nSingapore branches of DKB, Sumitomo, Tokai Bank, and IBJ have \nformally agreed to provide $250 million to the Malaysia Highway \nAuthority (Malaysia Kosokudorocho) in cooperation with two Malaysian \ncommercial banks.  The loan will be registered in an account in the \nLabuan market.  The Malaysian government has been promoting the \nLabuan market for the past few years, but by year-end 1992 its \noutstanding transaction balance was only $1 billion. The recent loan \nby the Japanese banks is the largest since they began entering that \nmarket in the spring of 1993.  Malaysia expects the Japanese banks \nto be the driving force behind the growth of the Labuan market. \n\n   Banks Financing Hong Kong Real Estate Development -- Major \ncommercial and long-term credit banks are stepping up real-estate- \nrelated financing in Hong Kong, according to the 3 January NIHON \nKEIZAI SHIMBUN (NIKKEI).  In September 1993, the Bank of Tokyo, \nFuji, Sanwa, Sumitomo and LTCB syndicated a loan amounting to \nHK$2.65 billion (roughly $343.3 million) to Cheung Kong (Holdings) \nLtd., a large Hong Kong real estate developer.  In addition, \nMitsubishi Bank and Sumitomo, among others,  provided funding to Sun \nHung Kai Properties, another major real estate developer, when it \nraised HK$900 million (roughly $116.8 million) to renovate office \nbuildings. \n\n   According to NIKKEI, in Hong Kong, which is considered the \ngateway to investment in China, the demand for office buildings and \nhousing continues to grow while prices continue to rise.  Hong \nKong's large corporations rely largely on Japanese banks for \nfinancing in the competitive real-estate development market. \n\n   MOF Appeals to Chinese Government on Behalf of Japanese Banks -- \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) is reportedly asking the Chinese \ngovernment to allow Japanese banks to deal in the Chinese yuan. \nAccording to the 15 January NIKKEI, currently, it does not allow \nforeign banks to deal in yuan. Thus, Japanese banks can only make \nloans and conduct foreign exchange in dollars or yen, while Japanese \ncompanies in China, as a result of a revision in the foreign \nexchange system on 1 January, are prohibited from holding or using \nanything but the yuan.  Consequently, Japanese banks cannot satisfy \nthe need of Japanese companies for interim operational funds. \n\n   NIKKEI reports, by the end of 1993, 10 Japanese banks had opened \n17 branches and 54 representative offices in China in response to \nthe government's reform and liberalization policy begun in the late \nl97Os.  But foreign banks are concerned that the recent revision of \nChina's foreign exchange system will be a major hindrance to their \nbusiness there.  Upon appeals from the banks, MOP has unofficially \nstarted working on getting authorization from the Chinese government \nfor the banks to deal in yuan. MOF's goal is not only to promote \npenetration by Japanese banks into the Chinese market but also \nindirectly to assist Japanese companies to invest there. \n\n   FEATURE:  Housing Lenders' Delinquencies Threaten Financial \nSystem -- SUMMARY:  Japan's housing loan corporations continue to \npose a major threat to the stability of the financial system, \naccording to press reports. Although virtually all of these \ncorporations implemented restructuring plans in the spring of 1993, \nbecause of the sluggish real estate market and the erosion of their \ntraditional lending market by other banks and the government-run \nHousing Loan Corporation (HLC), the housing lenders are reportedly \nstraining the major financial institutions that founded them. \n"
FBIS3-43955,"The military delegation of government and Renamo \n[Mozambique National Resistance] representatives recently \nreturned from the United States, feels that most of the \nknowledge gathered in that country is not feasible for \nMozambique given the different levels of development in the two \ncountries. \n  The delegation included Lieutenant Colonel Alfredo Maria and \nFrigate Captain Sebastiao Sarmento for the government, and \nLieutenant Colonel Buta Jose and Colonel Fernando Canivete for \nRenamo. Ministry of Finance inspector Henrique Gamito was also \npart of the delegation. \n  The delegation spent 27 days in the United States, having \nhad \na number of meetings with government departments, dealing mainly \nwith U.S. public opinion and the country's strategies for the \nprocess of pacification of Mozambique, U.S. experience in \ndemobilization and socioeconomic reintegration of demobilized \npersonnel, experiences of that country in the solution of \nconflicts and disputes of a social and political nature during \nthe process of development of democracy, and the National Guard. \n  Speaking briefly to NOTICIAS and AIM [MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION \nAGENCY] journalists yesterday, the members of the delegation \nsaid their trip to the United States was designed to find out \nabout the role of the military in democracy. \n  A member of the delegation said: We got acquainted with \nthat role during our visits to various U.S. states (Washington, \nLos Angeles, and others). [sentence as published] In our \ndiscussions we dealt with various issues relating to peace, \ndemobilization, and democracy, notably during the tour of the \nPentagon (U.S. Defense Department). \n  Asked about the manner in which they thought of implementing \nthe knowledge they acquired in the United States regarding the \nMozambique pacification process, they said not all of it is \nfeasible for our country given the major differences in levels \nof development. \n  According to them, the United States plans to demobilize \nabout 700,000 men by 1995, while assuring all the resources for \ntheir reintegration into socioeconomic life. Mozambique also \nintends to demobilize a greater number, but it lacks the \nresources (jobs, money, and other means). [sentence as \npublished] \n  A member of the delegation pointed out that for a country \nlike ours, that knowledge is only feasible when it comes to \norganization and training of personnel. \n  The trip of the Mozambican military delegation to the United \nStates was financed by the U.S. Embassy in Maputo."
FBIS3-33597,"Rio de Janeiro -- War College (ESG) Commander \nBrigadier Sergio Ferolla said yesterday that efforts to break \nthe state's monopoly on the research, production, refining, and \nmarketing of petroleum are the result of pressure from foreign \ngroups. In the brigadier's opinion, petroleum is a strategic \nelement, and therefore it is necessary to remain alert to the \ninternational interests that want to conquer the Brazilian \npetroleum reserves. According to the ESG commander, society \nmust not accept that Brazil be treated like a marginal country. \n  Ferolla advocated state control on petroleum exploration \nduring a Science Forum discussion and during a meeting with \nfederal university directors, both of which were held at the Rio \nde Janeiro Federal University (UFRJ). In his assessment, \nsociety has not discussed this issue at length, and it would be \ntoo early to implement such an important change. Ferolla \nclaimed: If the Constituent Congress decides to break the \npetroleum monopoly, it will be an untimely decision. In the \nESG commander's opinion, serious issues like those of \nmonopolies should be decided with more coldbloodedness and less \nemotion. \n  The brigadier said it was necessary for society to be more \nconscious to discussion of the great national issues. He asked \nthis especially from young people, who will be carrying out the \ndevelopment of our country. Ferolla believes Brazil lacks a \ndevelopment model that takes into account the great differences \nexisting between its regions. \n  Ferolla noted: We require strategic planning. This is not \na job for the military but for the whole of society, because the \nenemy is advancing. All it takes is to notice that our country \nis breaking apart. In the ESG commander's opinion, this \nplanning must not take into account the desires of the \nmultinational companies that are viewing the commercial side \nalone. He explained that this does not involve opposing the \nmultinational companies. Ferolla concluded: They may and must \ngain their money, but they must not meddle with our country's \nsovereignty. \n"
FBIS3-33601,"The Andrade Gutierrez construction group is looking \nfor oil in the maritime waters off Cuba. Having installed an \noffshore platform and using its own prospecting personnel, the \nBrazilian company is working on the island as subcontractor to a \nconsortium put together by Total, of France, and the Canadian \nfirm CMW. \n  Exploration of the Cuban coastline in search of petroleum \nbegan last year when risk contracts were signed with \nmultinational oil companies. Since it has no funds to meet any \nhigh-cost commitments, Cuba will use the oil taken from the \nbottom of the sea to pay the companies that operate there. \n<H5>  Indications of Oil </H5>\n  Andrade Gutierrez's efforts, explained Roberto Rivas, \ndirector for the Americas of the Cuban Cooperation Committee, \nfocused first on reserves that had already been analyzed by \nCuban Government geologists and geophysicists. We have \nindications that there is petroleum under the sea, said Rivas, \nwho is an important adviser to Carlos Lage Davila, considered to \nbe the strongman of that country's economy. \n  According to Andrade Gutierrez press advisers, the builder \nhas already fulfilled half the contract. The work began on 18 \nDecember 1993. So far, 1,760 meters of drilling has been done in \nthree 3,500-meter deep wells in Cardenas Bay, on the north of \nCuba across from Valadere beach (the country's biggest tourist \ncenter), according to reporter Elizabeth Rosa. \n  Andrade Gutierrez sets the total value of the project at $9 \nmillion. It took the firm, which began drilling oil wells in \nBrazil early in the 1980's, 13 days just to transport the \nplatform from Brazil to the Cuban coastline. According to \nGutierrez, the platform was inspected by international firms and \nconsidered to be in legal and acceptable condition in terms of \nthe United States trade embargo against Cuba. \n<H5>  Decline in Production </H5>\n  Even during the years of close ties to the Soviet Union, the \nCaribbean island had been producing as much as one million tons \na year of petroleum, Rivas noted. But since Soviet assistance \nended, local production has leveled off at about 500,000 tons a \nyear, not enough to satisfy domestic needs. \n  The state corporation in charge of business transactions in \nthe petroleum field--everything from prospecting to refining and \ndistribution--is Cupet Cubana de Petroleos. The current \noff-shore risk contracts, the director of the cooperation \ncommittee stated, will also have the effect of using the idle \ncapacity of the island's three refineries--one in Havana, \nanother in Santiago de Cuba, and a third in Cienfuegos. \nConsidered the most modern of Cuba's refineries, the plant at \nCienfuegos has the capacity to refine three million tons of oil \na year. \n"
